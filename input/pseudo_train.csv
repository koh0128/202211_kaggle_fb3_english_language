44E2726DA1B3,"your principal has decided all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. i agree because now days all kids do is stay home and be on there phones and do nothing. i know that because i used to do the same thing before and i didn't like to do anything at all but then i started playing a sport and it help a lot but i think that. participating in a extracurricular activity may help you by staying healthy, get you out of trouble,and get you in a good college.one example is staying healthy by playing a sport you can help prevent a lot of things like maintain a good weight, and keep you from getting sick. keeping a good weight is good for your health because it keeps you from getting other diseases,more than 1/4 of the people in the u.s. are obese. why not start at a young age and prevent from being sick and other things. another thing that can help is eating healthy, we can prevent sickness to in order to do that you might want to think about trying out a new sport.another example is getting you out of trouble you can avoid a lot of drama. i learned that social media can get you into a lot of trouble, half of the time a lot of the drama comes from social media. maybe if you join a club or a sports team you can think before doing something that can get you in trouble. one time my friend made the soccer team but she got in trouble so they kicked her off the team and she learned from her mistake and never got in trouble again. when in your in a cub or playing a sports half of the time you don't have time to be in drama get in trouble.last example is joining a club, working on the year book,serve in the student council and, playing a sport can get you into a good college now a days colleges are looking to see if you have participated in any sports or clubs. when i graduate high school i want to go to college and a study to be a general surgeon and participating in a sport or joining a club can help me get into a college. you meed new people when you join new clubs and make new friend ships. when you want to go into a club or in sports do something that you like not something your friends like or something that can help you in life with.in conclusion staying healthy,getting out of trouble,and going into a new college can help you when you participate in a extracurricular activity. staying healthy by playing a sports and eating healthy can prevent you from getting sick. staying out of trouble can avoid a lot of drama from school and social media think before you do something your going to regret . joining a club or participating in a sport can help you get into the college you want and you can meet new people and make new friend ships.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0
763EF698F56B,"well in this part i think is good and bad idea.i think is good because if they have any emergency in home they do not going to dismiss any classes they can take classes from home they have already tools do not needed to go outside they have everything in home, and the teacher they do not need to wake up early everyday, and also some family they are going to agree because now they do not are going to think every time how is my daughter or my son if they are safe or if they are in trouble.the bad things that if they going to give to all the students to take classes from only or video confederation some students they not going to do their work. in some others parts they do not have any internet or money to buy a computer they do not have opportunity that the others person have, also the teacher do not have any jobs they are going to need they works back, and some family they do not need to send to school to their sons because they do not have many or they want their son to work. is very different have the people think is hard to take decision.if they are old they can choose what they want, they have to think very careful if they said yes they want to take class form online , is going to be more easy from them because they do not have a job or they do not have to take care, they can do it they have a lot of time in the world if they do not have any computer thats is going to be a really good problem form them because they do not have school open or they do not have the materials they want for learn, they have to look for job but sometimes if your looking for a job they need to know how you was in school they need to see you record, you are going to need in the future.if you are going to say no because we need to learn something, we do not have any money to pay to go to school theirs so many ways to go to school their have school that are free you do not need to pay anything, just you need is go to school everyday, and do not get in trouble. is good idea if they do this in college for students they work they know, they have more responsibility.if you put a child with computer is going to be more concentrated in computer and maybe they going to have problems with their eyes or any problem when their grow up.if is a old is more easy from them because they brain is more they can understand and they do not have any issues to work in the computers.so is bad idea that they students take class form online they do not have any money or they do not work.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

9E2E1FDE4D15,"dear mr principal,i think students are require to take community service because it helps them get organized. it also helps out the community to be more cleaner. for example doing community service helps kids stay out of trouble such as gangs, violence, and drugs. also it helps kids to be more disciplined, more respectful, more caring for our planet, more careful, more safe, and more mature. one example is that kids who do community service are more organize. community service is helpful to kids that get bored at home.sometimes people think that doing community service is just a waste of time because they don't want to do it or they think that it is just boring. but community service can show you new things. such as taking care for the elderly, taking care of the planet, respecting others, and helping others. one last thing about community service is that it makes our community look more better than others, and it helps our community to be better for the people that live in our community. those are my reasons on why our school should do community service.sincerely, student_name",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
558299F3D69E,dear principali think that we shouldn't have to do community service if we don't have to time to do it. say if we play sports we wouldn't have the time of day to it and if you make us do it on weekends kids might not show up or some might become upset with you. so i think you should let the kids pick or if they do it give the some extra credit . i play sports and i only have time to help on the weekends and sometimes i will be tried and many other kids who play sports might feel the same way as i do.but if you do pick to make kids do community service i will understand why it helps kids learn to help out other people besides your self and some kids can really learn from just helping a couple of people out. but its up to you there are some positives and negatives with this choice.i think we should take a vote to see how many kids would like to do community service and who wouldn't. if a lot of kids don't then let the kids who want to go out and help do it. for the kids who don't maybe they will change their minds if their friends tell them how fun it is because they still are hanging out even if they are helping people out while they are doing it. i wouldn't know which to pick for a while i would ask my friends if they do it to give me some positives and negatives on it. then i would try it and see if i like it and if i do i will keep going along with this act.so this is a hard choice for you to pick but i would just go by the vote of your students. plus maybe a lot of kids will choose to do community service and you wouldn't have to make everyone do it . since i wrote this paper i think i would vote to do community service and i think i would convince some more kids to go along with this just to see how it is. then i see they whole school would come along to do this .thank you for reading this letteryour student,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0

B7EDCEA9137B,"dear principal,as a student of school_name, i disagree to have the new policy that students may not participate in sports or any other activities unless they have at least a b average grade. i disagree with this policy, because i think that many students work hard to get at least a b average, and maybe if the really love a sport and want to play in it then we should be fare and let them play. because then i think it wouldn't be fare if a student is just one or two points away from a b average and then not let them play, just because of one low grade or two points off. so then if there are only a little bit of students with a b average then there would be no teams or sports because all of the kids would not be eligible, also in the school activities there wouldn't be many kids there so it wouldn't make the activities as fun. although i do agree with you that if they do not have good grades and if they have to many u' s then they should not be eligible to play. therefore if they really loved sports and wanted to play in them, then they would try to raise their grade for it. so i disagree about putting and changing this to become a school policy.sincerely, student_name",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0

7B0D23FCA29B,"nine times out of ten children will get bad habits from not adding an extracurricular activity to their schedule.causing them to be lazy and end up with bad grades. because when you add at least one or more extracurricular activity to your schedule, it can help you be more social, get ready for high school, and have a healthier schedule.first, is being more social. when getting a new activity to do at the end of the day, you will end up with other people. meeting different people is one of the ways to clear bad social habits. because of the fact that they are in the same activity as you, some of them might have the same interests. this can cause you to have new friends, this will help you work with others. working with others is a good factor when you have an extracurricular, and it's not as hard as opinions might think. working with others has a bad side to it because of this you could get annoyed, but you can get use to it by building tolerance .the second reason is, that it helps you get ready for high school. to get ready for high school you are going to need a good gpa score meaning you need a high grade if not higher. getting an extra activity can help you if not guide you to the higher gpa. sometimes the teachers will give you extra credit activities or let you finish work that you want to get done.the third and final reason is building a healthy schedule. building a healthy schedule is very important because it can effect what you do now and what you will do in the future. when you add something to your schedule it will help you be able to take hard and stressful tasks. this will help you when ever you dont have a lot of people around to help.now some people might say that it's ""too hard"",""i just dont need it"" , or "" it takes too much time"". but student will need this when they have nothing else to do or when they have bad grades and they need help. this counter argument dose not compute with what is needed.if adding an extra curricular activity to a students time, then it will give them social skills, lead them to high school, and help build a healthy schedule. these are the main things that students need to be successful.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
58621C689C7B,i think you should use policy 1. allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time. i thing you should go with this policy because there is no need to take cell phones away. because almost all people have cell phones and that will mean they cant use it. and i think they should at least be able to use them on there free time as long as they are no bothering anyone and they keep it on vibrate .but i also belive that no one should use them during class because it will be a bother to every one and they wont be able to get there work done because someone would be sitting in class just texting on there phone. but if some don't bring phones to school at all then they wont be able to call there parents to pick them up or in case of a emergency. but the students should not be walking around the school talking on there phones just walking into people because there no paying any attention to what they are doing at all. and they should have there phones off during class to like i already said so no one is on there on there phone in the middle of class bothering people.using policy two is just going way to far because the only way that i would do that one is if all of the kids in the school get on there phones in the middle of class and just stay on it for the whole time without doing anything else without even paying attention to anyone or anything else. but policy one is more understanding because it is getting phones out of the way while they are working but not while they are on there free time because phones shouldn't bother anyone if its on there free spare time . but that is my reasen why i would go with policy one.,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0

9BD577FF5D3C,"dear principal,i strongly believe that students should get to have a c average to work in sports or other activities. without this opportunity, many children will lack in physical. with a b average, many students may not keep up to that level, which overtime, makes them grow weaker. not having activities and sports will hurt people physically, but also mentally. it can cause more stress to student's minds.students should get as much physical activity as they want, but if they have to have a b average, then this will make them get worse at what they may do best. these people should be getting enough freedom to do an activity for at least a c average. they will lack in physical skills and it may even mess up peoples dreams. if you know most of your students maintain at a c average, then leave them like that. of course, changing the policy might make them work harder, but its just not fair.students may see a positive change in there grade average, but if someone likes to play a sport, then there shouldn't be a change in policy. there will be a positive side, but also a negative side to it. students will get weaker without working in sports, or may even be much more lonely. in a young persons life, they don't want to be lonely. they want to be more social and talk with friends, participate in an activity. all these things help students grow up more healthier in life.some students may think its easy, but for most, it is hard. since most of your students have a c average, then there is some bad effects on changing it to a b average. one important thing is stress. every student wants to go to school stress free and going to special activities is a huge help in that. if people have to maintain a b average, it can add stress, because they are so caught up into trying so hard to maintain a b average. stress at a young age may cause students to have a more lonely life. they may not have a social life and be sad most of the time.as you see, principle, it is a much better idea to keep the policy the same. students will lack physical education, it will have a bad negative affect, and it causes more stress to students, if sports and activities are only open to b average students. people will not like this new idea because they used to have so much of a good time, but with this, it could possibly change their life a lot.from: student_name",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5

A44F6859B4D8,"do you think that we should have school activites? i think we should because it could possible benefit kid in learning. which means helping kids with better learning that is gong to benefit them by getting up and doing an activity that might help refresh their minds instead of the kid siting in class all day learning about something that might not be instresting to them and they might start to day dream and them not learning anything. i think the school should have activities for students.firstly, it would benefit a childs learning by refreshing their minds. according to a studies done by virginia techs mental studies, states that 74% of students fall asleep or day dream and stop listening and the other 26% of students listen and learn because they are involed in activities that help refresh there minds and givings them time to thing. what this means is that 74% of student stop listening do to being board or just no intrested but the other 26% is in a club or sport that helps that student refresh their mind and helps them think so they are ready for classes and other work that is needed to be done.secondly, depeneding on the activity it could help build a skill in a student. according to sports news website on collage sports, suggests that 25% of sports players in collage sports that train hard and keep lead to building skills that could help down the road and the other 75% of collage players that dont train hard and just sit around learn how to succed through failer. this means that the collage students that try their best are the one mostly building skills that will help them succed and the other 75% who dont try learn skills through not putting more work into it knowing what they need to try to improve on to become better.thirdly, trying something new could help find things you might like. according to a studies done at a virgina univitsy, suggest that 83% of the kid in school that had join club or sports had found a hobby that they enjoy doing and the other 17% of the students that took a club or a sport didn't or could find an intrest in that subject of activities. this mean that students found new hobby that enjoy to do in school when they have tine to do it and the students that didn't find a hobby that they dont enjoy probably dropped out of the club or the sport they were in.the other point of view, it would be another thing added to a students list and another thing they would have to stress about. according anderson shores a mental health studies doctor, states that 65% of students that have something else to add to their scedules stresses them do to having a bussy scedule already and the 35% percent of the other students do get stressed out do to not having a bussy scedule or they have good time management. this means that the students that have bussy scedules and cant add this to their scedules so they get stressed and dont know what to do, do to the fact of not being able to find time for it, and the other 35% has time for it so they can add it to their scedules. however this is true but let me tell you why this isnt the case for all students. according to a studies done on time managment, states that 80% of students could manage their time so they could do these activity and the other 20% said the reason they couldn't was do to not properly setting up a good scedule. basically this means that 80% had the time for it and the other 20% of students couldn't because they didn't set a scedule up properly or just didnt set one up.to sum it up, there should be activitys it help the student you the reader better learn and buil skill maybe even find a hobby that you like. i think the people that go against this shouldn't but that my opinion, and the reason i think they shouldn't is because it helps benefit learning it help the student refresh so they don't fall alsleep in class o start day dreaming because if they stop listening how are they going to learn. you the reader could do something about this you talk to other students or teachers and get their take on it. remeber your voice can be heard by many.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

F30B7DE35BBC,"dear principal,due to the following situation on being able to use phones in free time such as lunch or to not allow students to use phones at all. as a result i am writing to you telling you what i think they should do for this policy. i support the following situation on allowing students to use their phones during lunch and other free time, but has to be turned off during classes because students may need to contact a parent or guardian, some students just feel more comfortable having their phones with them, and also some parents might want them to have the phones with them in case of an emergency. think about it and think what would you want your school to have if you were in my position.to start with, because students may need to contact a parent or guardian and the school wont let them use there phone, because they don't think it is important. also some people need to call their legal guardian and ask them if they can stay after school, to study, do a project, or watch a sports game after school. since the school won't let them call home and ask they either don't go or go and don't call home.in addition, some students just feel more comfortable having their phone on with them. most people feel safer because it is always on and if they needed call anyone in case of an emergency. i know my mom would like me to have my phone on with me in case anything bad happened and i needed to call someone for help.in conclusion, most parents would feel more comfortable knowing that their kids phone is on and charged, so if they ever needed them they would call them and they would answer right away. don't forget to think about my ideas and i hope they put a big difference on you allowing phones to be used during free time like lunch and off during classes.i hope you thought about what you would want the principal to do if you were in my position. remember i support the following situation on allowing students to use their cell phones in free time during the school day and off during the class period because students may need to contact a parent or guardian, some students feel safer with their phones on, and some parents would like to know that their kids phones are on in case of an emergency.thank you for considering asking the students what they think.sincerely,a concerned student",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

BDE08546F7EE,"having online classes show positive and negative results in a student. online classes are like regular classes, that teaches you the standards of learning . like every other class, students listen to what the teacher has to say and answer questions on that objective, of what the teacher taught them.students that take online classes do have its benefits. for example, if you don't have enough credits, counselors tell students that are going to graduate if they do or do not have enough credits, they can take online classes. as long as you sign up with the school your attending, complete the course and earn the credit; they're able to graduate. another reason are programs, if you're in a high school program, you might have to take an ""exit-test"" exam. an example of that is c.i.s.l. (center of intelligence studies of languages), throughout high school you learn a new language, besides english, at the end of junior or senior year, and you'd take this exam to see how much you learn by taking an reading, writing, speaking, and listening test. another example is college, some young adults can't afford to leave home or to busy taking care of their family, to even see a sight of college in their future. that's why online colleges were made, to help those who can't help themselves nor have the money of affording a tuition. college online classes, are the same as high school you listen to a professor on a matter subject and take a quiz or test, from what you learned from them. another reason online classes are beneficial they're different schedule classes. for example you have to work 11:30 a.m. through 8:30 p.m. then you can schedule a class for 10:00 p.m. you can pick your time of the day class. different from being in a real school, you have to be at that class at a certain time and day, or you're marked absent or tardy.but there are also some consequences in online classes; online classes, are actually classes and real professors grade you on your work, so if your slacking or getting real low quiz and test scores, you've failed the class, and you don't get any credit from that class. then you have to redo the whole course, because with no credit you can not graduate. another reason online classes have negative results, is that they have the rights to kick you out the class, in the beginning of the course, they're suppose to give you an agreement and term contract, and if your attendance is poor, they'll kick you out the class.however, i believe that online classes are very beneficial for students. to take classes from home or from school, doesnt really matter, as long as you get the class credit and complete your recommencement, you can graduate.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
C38334385924,their are some schools that offer to attend online classes or video conferencing what if they don't have a computer at home for to be able to use it for the online class. some parents will not agree i think because they will be working and they don't know with who they can leave their kids with. video conferencing could work for students instead of online classes because that way the person that will come to teach you can explain more better from the assignments that your suppose to do. some students just prefer someone to teach them for they can help with what they are doing. students will benefit from being abkle to attend classes from home will some students they would rather take classes home then school because in school they think it's more harder for them for the reason of being with alot of stusdents. they like to work alone quite and with someone who can have patients and work slowly and have time. same thing with there schedule when you have classes at home you can choose the time and day that you want to do the class.,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
E64E850E6E71,"perhaps you are trying to decide which college or university you should go to or what outfit you should wear to a high school graduation. after pondering between your variables, you would ask your family, friends, or mentors for their opinions so you can make better choices. people sometimes talk to more than one person when seeking advice, to make a better choice. seeking multiple opinions can help someone come to a smarter decision because of the variety of opinions that they are given, and an individual choice you can make out of those opinions.when you ask for opinions on which university you should go to after your high school graduation, the answers between your parents and the answers from your friends might be different. your parents could say that uva is better than a college in new york or california because its close to home. they could also say that uva is instate, which means its less expensive. meanwhile, your friend might say that the college in new york is better than uva, because you get to experience the freedom of living in a completely new place while making your own decisions. they could say that places like new york and california is way more fun than staying in your hometown. when you ask for advice from multiple people instead of just one person, you get a variety of opinions and perspectives to help you to make the right decision.when you are given multiple opinions on the choice you are trying to make, like which university you should go to, you gain more information on both of the schools your trying to decide between. all of that information helps you to find what you want out of a school. when given multiple opinions, you can decide if your willing to live with all that freedom and responsibility in somewhere like new york city, and if your ready for it. or you can confirm to yourself that your not ready to leave to somewhere completely different and far away, and you can't afford an out of state university. those opinions can help you eliminate a variable, by thinking, ""am i ready for what that person is advising?"" ultimately, you are making your own decision, with others helping you realize your strengths and weaknesses, and what your opinion is.through the advice and opinions that you receive from multiple people, you can decide and make a better choice individually. each person that you ask for advice to will answer differently, and out of all of those opinions, you can create your own opinion and find out what variable is better for you. other peoples opinions are helping you decide and realize what you want out of something, so you can make a better choice.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

370732B4F376,"when it comes to seeking advice, it is always good to look for different sources. it is very valuable to have opinions from other people that a person can lean on. it is common for people to ask others for things from simple, to complicated scenarios. i believe looking for multiple opinions from different people when a person asks for advice to make a better decision is important because it could lead the person's mind up to more options, it could lead the person to very opinionated or buyist thoughts, and it could help take stress of the person when needing advice.the first reason i believe asking for advice from different people can help decision making, is because of the different options. having different options when making a decision is very important because there are open choices that are good and bad. every day people ask for advice whether it comes from finding what clothes to wear, to asking for advice if you should get married or not. that benefits a whole lot because sometimes all a person needs is a barrier to select between. imagine if a person was at the store trying to buy something for their mom on her birthday. the person had to choose between a hand bag or some expensive sunglasses they had found; although, they didn't know what to get her. however they brought one of their siblings to help choose. i think having people to help you make a right decision every once in a while is necessity in life, even though you don't want to get overly used to it.the second reason i believe seeking advice from different people can help benefit decision making is because of the buyist thoughts from others. it can help if you have a friend or family member you can trust that has a strong opinion, because sometimes you need it. there is always going to be a couple or strong people in your life that's going to help you make right decisions either if you are going down the wrong road, or if you are doing the right thing in life and you just need motivation. if a person was struggling in high school and they really needed to step up their life and grown up more, they would really need to good influences or somebody to tell them where they are going wrong. people that can step up with their own voice on the situation that has known the person, and that could really help them get their life together. personally, the type of people everyone needs is somebody that has strong beliefs and values and that would care for their loved ones. that could especially help in benefiting someone's life going toward the futurethe last reason i believe looking for advice from different people can help with decision making is because of the lower amount of stress you get. it is hard at times when you are trying to do your best but you need help in doing the right thing. if a person didn't have someone role models or people to help with choosing the right things to do either growing up or in life, then they wouldn't know how to do anything but using their own way of thinking. a lot of stress people get in there lives is from being without anyone to help them and that could really mess with a person's mind. most of the times when people do have other people in their lives, they make the right choices. if they do good in school, they will most likely go to college, then they could work and level up to be a manager or have their own business. there are so many benefits or having supporters to influence you to doing the right things. a lot of the time it isn't that hard to find a right clique.these were my reasons on how having advice and opinions from different people can definitely help a person out. all anyone needs in life is just a group of close people to be right by your side to help in life. i wish you enjoyed reading this and really could really understand how these reasons could help influence a person to make the right decisions just from a little advice. all in all this concludes my essay and i hope my reasons have inspired anyone that all you need is a little help.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5
EDE56797770A,"dear teacher_namei think that people shouldn't have to do community service unless they get into legal trouble such as a fight, and they are charged with assault. or if someone steals something and they are charged with stealing.i think that as long as someone does what he is supposed to do then it is okay that they don't have to do community service. like how would you feel if someone just put a task in front of you without your permission, when you could be studying, or exercising to prevent not being fat like this country is now, and not being dumb like most of the country is. so i say that we should really be doing things that can help ourselves and do community service whenever we want. because if you force someone to do something, we wont like it. so if you make people do community service nobody will do it. we will just say we did it even though we didn't. and tree huggers, aka environmentalistsanyway they are obsessed with the earth but what they don't get is that big companies are starting to fund research to find greener ways to help the environment so that we can run on electricity. we shouldn't do it because we are kids and we don't have to go and pick up trash in the middle of the road where cars are coming and trucks can hit us. and the government is already slowly demolishing our freedoms to save the little fishies that swim in gutters. they live on algae and stuff so why ban phosphates in dishwasher detergent, or get rid of mercury in light bulbs and have the green light bulbs which shine too bright or too dull. so the government really shouldn't take our rights away. so i say if they are doing something about it we shouldn't have to worry about it. so elementary kids can learn by their teachers. why in the heck do kids that learn how to spell need tutoring? their teacher should teach them, or their guardians or whoever the heck they live with tutor them, why don't they help the kids and not us, when sometimes we mess up on the stuff too. why cant we go do something with our lives because we make our lives. we don't need anyone else to control them. so don't force us to do something we don't want to do, or buy something we don't want to buy, or force us to not buy something so we eat with dirty dishes.we live on this planet too!!!and lord help us all when the world ends, because by the looks of it, we don't have the time to do everything we need to because we are fat and dumb. so if you make us do community service we will not do good in school because we are too tired to do anything. if you put in a sleep time that would be nice though. because i remember in pre-k no-one wanted to sleep, and now i want to sleep every period and i'm in 8th grade. so seriously, please switch that around. thank you for taking your time to read this thing, even though we should be in class studying something else.sincerelystudent_name",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
8586AF2475F3,"dear principal,i have been told that you wanted to change the policy on the grade students should have to play in sports (if you have a grade c average than you wouldn't be able to play) , and that you also wanted the students views on that. well i am a student here at school_name and i know for the majority, most kids wouldn't think it fair if you went into action with this policy, and there are other reasons you shouldn't put this policy into action too, here are some of them.one reason why you should put this policy into action is because if the majority of the students have a grade c average at your school, then school_name would lose many team members, this policy might make you think it would encourage kids to have better grades, but it might affect the team for those who want to slack off, not even necessarily slack off because a grade c average isn't even failing. unless you want the school's reputation to go down by losing many games because they have little members, than you could follow through with this policy. but i wouldn't encourage it.another reason why i wouldn't encourage putting this policy into action is because a grade c average isn't considered failing, and in most schools for activities they won't let you participate if you are failing, but it would be fine with them if you had a grade c average. not that we are in competition or anything but i am sure school_name wants to be represented as a good, cool, and fair school.also another reason could be because maybe a student has a grade average c in one of their elective classes, now that definitely wouldn't be fair if someone didn't get to do sports because they had a grade average c in an elective class. electives are supposed to be a privilege, not something you should base whether they play sports or not. and the fact that they had a grade average c in that class and saying that they couldn't play sports wouldn't be fair because if they aren't even failing the class then they should have the right to play.these are a few reasons why you shouldn't tell kids they can't play sports if they a grade c average. think these reasons over and thank you for the time being that you read this letter.- a concerned school_name student.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
8F55A0B21609,"cell phones while drivingi think people shouldn't be able to use their phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle. my first reason is that it can cause people to either harm themselves or others who are in the vehicle with them or, the person whose car they come in impact with while on their phone while operating a vehicle. second reason is because due to the lack of concentration while driving being the phone while operating on a moving vehicle is one of the main causes of most wrecks in the united states, which is the leading cause to distraction in a car is a cell phone.""resources show that according to the national safety council that 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone and at least 341,000 involved in text messaging."" also talking on the phone while driving is becoming more and more life threatening when multitasking behind the wheel of an operated vehicle.everyday there's always someone whose severely injured or either worst end up dead because of the use of using their phone while operating a vehicle of any kind. i truly believe that using a phone while driving shouldn't be allowed, because for safety the driver needs to be more cautious for their life and the other person who is in another car that the driver who wants to be on the phone while driving comes in impact with all because they refuse to wait until they get to the destination that they are going. i know some opponents whose work is literally dependent on the use of a cell phone every single day such as people like lawyers entrepreneur's and business men believe that they have to always be available to answer the phone at all cost just to make sure their business or cast is still running smoothly.some people believe that using a phone while driving isn't the reason wrecks happened. some say the cause comes from people who get too into whatever they're looking at or they get too occupied with the conversation with the other person that's on the other end of the phone.which makes them take their attention of the road which leads to people not seeing a vehicle pulling out in front of them and then they rear end each other. as i said before i believe that people shouldn't use their phones while driving, but if you look at it from another person's point of view you start to wonder if like what if the person is a person who is sick and needs to be checked on every now and then, or someone who has to have assistance on something.when people think of safety they think of like seatbelts and driving and they don't think that having their phone in their possession while driving might doesn't seem like it would cause a lot of damage but it truly does because of the higher risk of impact on a person's car from not paying any attention to the stoplights, stop signs, speed limits, or the caution lights between a four way stop. in my opinion i believe that some people could use their phone while driving and still have their focus on the roads and cars beside them or in front of them and don't cause any wrecks, but then again i still believe phones shouldn't be used while driving just for safe benefits.people who don't use a phone while operating a vehicle have a greater change of living than a person who is paying no attention to the road and cars near them because their focus is on their phone. you're most likely to survive when you're worried about your phone and getting into wrecks because your man focus is on the roads and cars next to and in front of you.works citedteen driver source.

EDDFFD34DBD4,is it better fro you to ask for more advice or less? in my opinion i believe that the more advice your gaining from different sources is crucial and here are a few reasons why i believe that.the first reason is that the more sources you talk to it's more likely your going to get more advice then just talking to one source. on top of that if you talk to more sources they will most likely have different opinions from one another. along with the other reasons the more different opinions those sources have the more advice youre taking in so you can make a smarter decision for yourself.the second reason i believe it is better to talk to multiple source's is the decision the more advice you gain from the sources makes the decision a lot easier for you to make it would also help you make the correct decision. from experience it's a lot better to get more advice than a little amount. i needed some advice about a game to buy so i went to one of my closest friends he told me to get a game that he had and it would be super fun if we both played it together. but i was pretty hesitant of just buying the game because i didn't think i would play it very much because it didn't seem that interesting to me so what i did was went to a couple more of my other friends and they all suggested a different game than what my best friend suggested but they all suggested the same game everyone else did though and since they all had the game i went with the game they suggested and now i play it almost everyday with them.the third reason i believe it is smart to talk to multiple source's for taking in advice instead of just talking to one source is opinions. the source's could have different opinions if you talk a lot different sources you might hear something you didn't even think about and that could change the solution to your problem for the better or for the worse. like with the video game situation listened to my other friend's game suggestions i would had wasted my money on something i wasn't going to play i did listen to my other friends opinions i bought something i want to play. so you see that even strange suggestions can help make a decision on if you want to buy or sell or maybe even keep something. but like i said different suggestions can have a great impact on what your decision may be because without my best friend's suggestion i wouldn't have gone an talked to my other friend's about what i should buy.those are three reasons why i would talk to multiple different source's and get there advice instead of just talking to only one source and getting a microscopic amount of advice compared to the amount of advice i would get talking to multiple source's.,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

97E7DD4E7C69,"''hey, should i wear this or this tomorrow?'' i'm sure we've all had a friend ask us our opinion's on something, like what to wear on the first day of school, but ever wonder why they go and ask others on their perspective as well? the majority of people tend to ask more than one person about their thoughts on something because they want to know what the most common response is and they want to see other people's perspectives besides their own while keeping an opened mind.first, the reasons why a person wishes to seek the most common response. someone such as a friend will usually ask more than one of his/her piers on their thoughts or opinions on something and will go on asking more people the same question. after, he/she will take all the responses they have received and will most likely go with what the majority of what their piers said. people tend to do this because they want to have an open mind about what a group of people think rather than just one person. next, why seeking multiple opinions can lead to a better choice. by asking multiple friends, piers, and even family members their thoughts on something that may or may not be important, it could help save someone from making a bad choice in the future. to conclude everything that was previously stated, asking for multiple opinions is a great way to double check if someone is making the right choice because they will have stopped them from making a choice that they could have regretted ten years from then.second, why its good to see other people's perspective besides your own.i know when i need someone's opinion i dont just ask one person i ask all my friends and even some of my family member's before i make a decision, and i also ask why they went with that choice to have a better understanding as to what helped them conclude to their response. by looking through someone else's perspective it could lead to a more open mind and can give a person more room to understand what other people think and why they think it . next, why its special having an open mind. having an open mind is when someone is able to take other people's opinions and instead of judging it they try to understand it. i believe people who ask for multiple opinions are very open minded and are willing to listen to other people's perspective besides their own. in conclusion, it is always important to keep an open mind when asking other people for their opinions or advice.to conclude this entire essay, when someone is asking for advice or opinions about something they are just trying to keep an open mind are trying to make the right decision that they wont regret later in their life. so next time someone asks for an opinion don't get jealous when they walk away to ask another person the same question, remember that they are just trying to keep an open mind and they want to hear what others have to say too.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

DC364EC72968,"reasons why you should ask for advice are so you dont make anyone mad, get the job thats good and fits you well and so it dousnt knock you down and ruin your life. you don't want to mess up you future so ask for help and choose wisely. never do something so suddenly without thinking because you might hurt yourself physically or mentally or other always think beofre acting.people should ask for multiple opinions because often their sudden choices could come back to haunt them later in life. for example someone could decide to get a tattoo but they didnt ask people how it could effect them or if it was a good idea or not, then later they cant get the job they want. later in life they might regret it or start disliking the tattoo or the decision that they made that they didnt get multiple opinions on. because as you get older your mind set will change and the people around you will change, not everyone thinks the same though, some people might think an idea is good but a couple think its bad. if it is the idea is health hazardous then it could come back and might make you have health problems and maybe even die earlier. so the point is to always ask for advice so it doesnt come back later to ruin your life.not getting multiple opinions could make your family mad at you for not asking them and getting their opinion on why they think its good or bad. they might hate what the idea was and since they were not asked or told about it they feel betrayed. but if you asked for advice or help they might help you make a better decision for yourself. everyone wants to make the right decision but if you need a little help sometimes ask someone who already does the thing you want to do, or ask your family what would be best for yourself. if you dont ask you could make the wrong decision and and end up needing your family for help later and living with your parents. so you never want it to fail that bad so if your hesitating to do something ask someone should i do this and why? always ask people for advice and help because if you dont it could ruin your life.another reason you should ask for advice to make a better decision is so you can get more informed on the topic. people that have done the job before can teach you and tell you tips and tricks, that is good because you might be good and some of the things youll have to do. knowing the job is everything so if you can find out all the helpful tips you'll be good. they can also tell you what there favorite part of the job was and what they had to do a lot. that can be helpful because if you love working outside and on the job for example you have to work outside a lot maybe you should consider it. they can also tell u what they had to do a lot that they hated that can help because if you hate something that you have to do for work you're not going to want to do it and maybe you should consider something else. most people want to have a job they like not a job they like part of but most of the time hate their job. so you should always asked a experienced person that has done what you want to do and ask for there advice if you should apply for the job or not.in all i think people should ask for advice and at least 3 people before making a decision so it doesn't come back to knock you down and slow life down for you, so no one will get mad over the decision your making and ask a professional before saying yes or no to see if the job will be good for you. because we all want the best for eachother if someone does ask you for advice tell them what you think and how you feel because later you might need to ask them for advice. that is why you should always ask for more then 1 person for advice and ask for advice or help in general.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

(""putting on a happy face"" actually works!)"". this proves that it has been proven by experts that this system could help spread positive vibes. ""whoever thought that making faces could receal so much about the science of emotions!"".finally, the facs could help identify when students are bored and are not paying attention. this will help a student pay attention and not stay behind. the solution to this would be to modify the infromation to be interesting or less difficult for a student. i assume that this would decrease the amount of missing assignments and improve grades. this will be better fro the students to gain knowledge.in conclusion the facial action coding system should be used in classrooms for students. they will help improve their interest in topics at school, help the students understand better, it will help students be more possitive, and finally is will have a big impact on all of us. the facial action coding system would be a new way of gaining more knowledge. it will help students and teachers understand eachother better. overall this would be a positive impact amoung us all.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

51582221FB88,"do you think students would benefit from being able too attend classes from home? in my option i would say of course. because today you see many people allowing or wanting there child to be able to do there work at the comfort of there home. simply because some kids learn better at home,in some cases it could be there is less distractions surrounded around them for examples class clowns,bullies,girls,friends and maybe even the class pet. but don't get me wrong there is some people who would rather learn from a teacher and be able to ask live questions. maybe even find learning from home could be a distraction because of siblings and things of that nature.the main reasons i feel like it would be a good idea is because i feel like everyone should have a option to send there child to a normal school or to do schooling online. because everybody are not in the same shoes and when i say that i mean like as much as one person parent makes compared to the others. in example when kids don't feel compturble around there peers because of the cloth they wear. maybe because of the way they look so they don't ask questions in class. so they don't wanna bring attention to them selves. but with a online teachers and being at home they will be able to contrate better and pay attention. because they don't have anybody to worry about judging them for there answers or even the cloth they wear on there back. also this is just one of my many big reasons i feel like this should happenanother major reason i have in mind is that some students work to help them selves or the house hold. because there parents may need just a little bit of help or sometimes students may watch there siblings while there parents are at work. if we did school online i know it would not last 8 hours of the day so that gives u time to rest before u go to work. maybe even give you more time to put on the clock, also it could help with making a student better at being independent. if its like edunuity which are online classes because it shows dates and time frames for you to finish your work. it helps you learn time management and you choose when u begin your work during the day.my next and final reason is if school was online we would not have to wake up early in the morning to attend school. we could start are online course when you wake up refreshed from a good enough amount of rest. you can begin to do your courses and maybe even the times when students are sick. begin to feel better during the day or you where only feeling bad during the morning. could go ahead and still complete the work that they would of missed. if you where in school and would have to do the work the next day after you feel better.these are all my major reasons i feel we should do school online. i just feel as it would have a better impact on the students learning and independent skills. if we did begin to do online courses it should start in high school because that's when students begin to mature and they could handle doing work at home better.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0

3B93FA6833FA,"dear principal,i believe that your possible new policy could really help the students who want to play sports also focus on their studies. i believe that some of the reasons that you should change the policy is, for one reason, the students can focus on their studies, for two, they can play sports and they also must make time for their studies as well as extracurricular activities such as sports and lastly, they will be able to focus on getting above a b average.i am also a little against the idea because some gifted students in sports are not academically gifted. this wouldn't give them the opportunity to be as best they can be in sports if they focus upon the negatives of not being on the sports team they are on. if you change the policy, then some kids who are great at their sport won't be able to help their school win any sporting competitions.while the kids can focus on their studies, they can make a larger and brighter future. many students who have a c average can try to focus upon their studies and maybe even get above the b average. the students can be great at juggling their time for their future lives as adults. this policy can help the students be the best they can be in anything.the b average,i think is a little to high for some of my peers. many don't focus upon their studies and teachers are time and time again to get them above their showing level of academics. academics must have several students who try hard for their goal for whatever it is they want to do with their life. if somebody wants to be a millionaire, they have to work on being that throughout their life. be a millionaire doesn't just come to you. you have to work your whole life for being this. if they want to be a hotdog man, a trash man, or even a mcdonald's cashier, then they will have very little self-respect and very little low-self esteem.i also oppose this policy because the students who wish to be a sports star must have good grades in college, but if they get below a b average in elementary, middle, or high school, then so what? the students try to juggle social and academics and if your grade skips a little bit, then they can't be on their team.so, as you can see, i am of a spilt mind as to what i want you to do. i think that it would be both a great idea and bad idea, but whatever you choose, i am sure that it will be for the students best benefit and for the parents' as well.sincerely,student_name",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

600D15606C01,"do you ever want fun activities to do at school? having an extracurricular activity helps students that don't want to come to school, encouraging them to come more frequently and enjoy the time they have at school instead of dreading school. i think students having at least one extracurricular activity would be a great idea because, students can learn new things for example playing sports includes learning how to play. making new friends in other activities like student council , and having interaction with other peers like in the yearbook committee.first, extracurricular activity can bring students to learn new things about that specific activity and even the things they learned will help them in real life in the near future. for example, ffa can help those students, how to grow crops for food supplies, and how to take care of farm animals like what to feed them that is healthy and nutritious for the animals. another example is fccla helps volunteer at animal shelters or any type of shelter that needs volunteering and even learn how to take care of dogs and cats, how to feed them, and care for those animals that need help.second, students can meet new peers and become friends with each other. for example, a group activity that involves five or more people in a group to work on a project, if one student was sitting all by herself and had no one to talk to or work with for that activity and this one person sees them sitting alone at one big table that person might invite her to come sit with them so, they can work on the project together and them two might find they have things income and become friends. then, that encourages them to help others to become friends.lastly, interaction with others is very important in these activities. for example, working in the yearbook committee involves students to talk about what to do and what to put in the yearbooks, taking pictures might involve talking to communicate where the other student will be while taking those pictures, and printing the yearbook out will need learning how to print papers.these three examples are perfect reasons for having extracurricular activities for each student in the school today. what do you think about having these extra activities at school? having activities like this encourages them to come everyday and it makes them enjoy school more than not wanting to come. the school can have many different extracurricular activities they can join for example, sports that helps them how to play it right step by step, the student council helps students become friends and have communication skills and the school yearbook committee helps them with interaction, communication, and teaches them how to take pictures on cameras and print out many different things. this is why i think this school and the students should have at least one activity to do during school hours to keep them busy and want to come to school more everyday.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
3BE93D14041D,"there are many reasons i can think of why people need more than one persons advice and some are life changing. in the next few paragraphs i will explain the reasons i can think of why you need multiple peoples advice. although i feel i need to clarify why we need advice in general. advice is mainly helpful for learning, also it can help those who don't see what they should do, but if you got bad advice it might effect your whole life. now that i've clarified that, time to continue with the question.first reason, multiple viewpoints on the topic or compare and contrast. now this reason would probably apply to someone who is seeking advice before a decision. an example of this reason : generic_name needs a new bike,so he goes in the bike shop and ask his friends for advice on which bike he should get and they do now. generic_name goes to the counter and the cashier gives him some advice so now he can compare and contrast the bikes in his head and decide which one to get. in the example generic_name has three point of views on the different bikes so he could easily make a choice. this is like research but from people who have done the research. also advice comes from friends and family mostly so you know it isn't bad advice.second reason, bad advice. when you get bad advice you what to get more advice from some one else or maybe you don't even know if it is bad advice that is why always get more than one person to get advice from. now for an example: you just turned twenty and you're still living with your parents so you go to your bad friend house because you think he has cool job probably. so you get to his house then ask him and he says you could join my gang we do cool things and get a lot a money you think about talking to your other friend but then you say yes anyway. the next day you go to jail for murder because your friend comited murder to rob a bank. you were sitting in a car waiting for your friend to get out of the bank you didn't think that he hurt or robed anyone. now you in prison for forty years and your friend for life. when you were about to get your good friends advice you didn't but if you did you would realize how bad of an idea that is and would of been fine, so never be to careful.now i could list a few more but these are the main ones and most important. the first reason is useful and the second is for your safety.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

6910A7FECEEA,"dear principle,i highly urge you to take some things into consideration before making your final decision on the policy change. many students participating in sports have a c grade average. if you change the policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a b grade average, many students will not have anything they participate in besides school. how healthy could that be? it isn't. i believe you should make a policy that allows anyone with a c grade average or higher allowed to participate in sports and other activities. if they have a d or f grade average, then i agree that they should spend more of their time working on school work so they don't fail, but why make the students be above average just to participate in something besides school? i have three important reasons for pressing the matter. firstly, if the students are not near the risk of failing, they should have the chance to participate in sports and other activities. secondly, sometimes being in a sport helps students to have better concentration and energy, which will cause them to be better in school. and lastly, if students have something to participate in they will be more willing to try harder in school.think about this. if someone has always gotten c's and has been able to maintain an average grade, then they shouldn't have to try to be above average just to be able to play a favorite sport. this may cause students stress and anxiety. if you lower the policy to a c grade average, then the children just might do better in school overall.concentration has always been a big deal in school hasn't it? participating in sports will help students have better concentration and energy for school work. it is proven that if a student has more participation in other activities, that they do twice as good as those that aren't in other activities. why cause them to have to have a good grade to do sports, when they could get better grades by doing sports?one last thing to think about is if students have something to participate in, wouldn't they want to try harder in school to be able to stay in that sport or activity? motivation is always a major helper in school work. would that not be a good motivation?now that you understand my reasons for wanting to avoid the change in policy, please think a little harder about it. if c's are average, why change that? being a sport or other activity, may sometimes give the students more concentration and energy therefore, help them to do better in school. if students have something to participate in, wouldn't they want to try harder? thank you for taking these major reasons into consideration.sincerely, a student.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5

2CFBD4AA7BE5,"what do you like to do after school? the answer is probably go home and relax. but wouldn't it be great if everyone did an extracurricular activity. their is so much fun and exciting things to do other than just go home and relax for the rest of the day. i think kids should have to do extracurricular activities because you make new friends, you help out your school, and it creates other opportunities.while doing extracurricular activities you can make new friends. making new friends is bound to happen while doing extracurricular activities, you and another person are just going to click and get along with each other very well. making friends with the people that do the same extracurricular as you can have a lot of benefits. take this for example; i play football and my friend generic_name doesn't. so when i try telling generic_name about the struggles that i am going through on the football team or something important about the team, he can't help me with my problem because he is not involved. but, if i have a friend on the team then he can help me with my problems and i can also help with his or her problems. overall, extracurricular activities help make friends that can help you through things.some extracurricular activities help out the school and the community a lot. it may be in a small way but it still helps. groups that make the yearbook or students that serve on the student council are helping the school out. they are helping to keep the school in order and to keep students happy. other extracurricular activities like football and basketball help their school and community by winning games this helps the school make money, it helps the community by providing entertainment. some schools even have environmental clubs that help the school, the community, and even the world. all in all, extracurricular activities help the school and community.most importantly extra curricular activities create more opportunities. when doing extracurricular activities you might find out that you are really good at something. people that are good at sports often get scholarships to play sports in college. you might write a school news paper and find out that you are a really good writer and could possibly become a writer or find another job that involves writing. also doing these extracurricular activities will go on your resume and help you get into college. extracurricular activities create so many opportunities it is outstanding.in conclusion, extracurricular activities have a lot of benefits. they can help you make friends, help your school and community, and create new opportunities. people may not want to do extracurricular activities but it will help you out later on in life and you will have plenty of fun.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5

03CD4C5553A4,"dear principal,the adrenalin that you receive from sports is both vigorous and thrilling. however, if students are prevented from doing the one thing they enjoy and are passionate about, it takes away from apart of their lives and persona. having a c average is still passing and that's what we should contemplate on, not a b average. if we eliminate the sport activity from the child it wont benefit them. this would only lower their self esteem, cause them to be less healthy, and make them believe they wont be successful without playing the sport they love.self esteem is a problem in most of our generation's children. they worry about their self image and what people think. however, while playing a sport they are engaged in something they love and they are no longer fixated on what people think about them. when children enter a sport they require practice and getting in shape. so, if a student is out of shape and has insecurities they work that extra lard off by entering a sport. their grade should not be the reason to if they can participate in a sport or not.also, our school offers an excellent class called health. moreover, they tell us that we should exercise because it helps us in the long run. but, if we take that away because of grades the kids may become more lethargic and not being able to even keep up with a c average! the effects would make the child's grade lower and possibly their status as a student would drop also.teachers say well if we keep on letting them play their sport then they wont try to keep their grades up at all. no, that is not entirely true. a way to fix this predicament is to have consequences and tutors. for example, if a basketball player receives a 65 on a test. tell them that they can't start their next game unless they can pull it back up. also, if you have tutors ( especially for the ones who struggle in math) it could help then bring their grades up to a b and possibly an a. these kids don't purposely try not to accomplish as its just hard for them to do it. all they need is a push.some students know that they are exceedingly well at playing their sport. but, on the other hand, they know that they do not achieve so much academically. so, they aspire to do well in a sport and when that is taken away from them based on how they perform in class they believe they wont be successful in life and if they think that way then they most likely wont try to be. for instance my friend, relative_name, was the best football player i knew. just by the looks of him, he was destined for greatness. however, his school followed the policy to where people who were involved with sports and activities had to have a b average. well, relative_name wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed and could only keep up with a c average so he had to be kicked off the team. unfortunately, now he can't even keep his grades up to a d and has failed a grade. and, this was all because he was snatched away from the one thing he loved. now, he doesn't even care what his grades are because he knows that he wont be able to play foot ball.sports and activities are a passion for people that runs through their veins like nobody's business. so, what would be the benefit of the school taking that away? nothing. children get involved in activities because they love it and they would rather do nothing else. if we strip them from that then what else do they have to cause them to be ambitious in life? it's hard to tell but we know they wont have a passion.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

"" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" dr. huang predicts this is going to be a very good thing for teachers, because teachers will be able to know what a kid is feeling this means that the teach will no longer have to keep going over the same information with the same kids just because one kid does not understrand it or isnt paying attention. the teacher can focus on those targeted students spicificly, and not have to go over the same information multiply times. knoledge is a great thing to have.one good benifit from this is that teachers can teach more to kids in a more faster way so they can get more things done, because the facs will tell you if the kids understands the information and or get bored that way techers can work with those kids in a different time and move on to more things with the kids that do understand it.having computers that can read kids expresions to tell you whether you are bored or confused is a genius idea. it will be a good thing for both reachers and kids. the science behind it is also neat for people to understand how it came about the facs.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

E2669D67879F,"my principal wants to change that we must have a b average to be in any sport. my opinion is no, because a student might not get a subject therefore that student has a lower average. it is also hard to maintain a b average when being in a sport because you are worried about both grades and that sport and also maybe things that are going on in your life.but maintaining a b average can also help you. if you are in a sport, you say to yourself ""hey if i keep my grade to a b average, then i can stay in my sport. "" that to me is what helps most kids or teens that are in a sport . i could also see why my principal would change the grade is, because he/she has more students trying out for sports and also that he needs a good grading report from all of his students and half of his students are in a sport so that is why.so therefore maintaining good grades would help a lot not just to the students but also to the school. more students need to pay more attention to school so they can be in sports. sports is a great way for students to get a great education and to maybe someday get a scholarship to college. that would make me very happy if i got a scholarship to college from having great grades and for being in sport that is what i think would be best.thank you for your time,your students",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

ACCD71550365,"do you think it is a good idea to succeed? i believe it is good to succeed in life, that is why seeking opinions from multiple people helps you succeed. i believe seeking help from multiple people can help you make better decisions. a couple reasons why i think that is, it helps you succeed in life, it helps when making a decision, and an example is that i made a great decision in my life.first, seeking multiple opinions helps people succeed in life. one way is when going to college. college is very important to people's life and people giving opinions to them is encouraging them that is will be fun. another way is when a person is mad at somebody. people encouraging them to stop can help them stop being mad. the last reason is when somebody is taking a test they can get help. when they are stuck then can ask a question to the teacher and can get a opinion on the question and then that can help them get the question right. get multiple opinions it will help you succeed in life.second, getting multiple opinions helps when making a decision. it helps when picking out what shirt or shorts or any type of clothing they want. when they dont know what type of clothing they want to buy multiple opinions can help a lot when not knowing what to get. it also helps when picking which shoe they want and which one is the best for them. opinions from parents and the workers that are helping the person will help them see if the shoes fits and if it is the right type for them. it also helps when the person doesnt know which place they want to go to. getting opinions and ideas from friends will help when picking which place you want to go. multiple opinions helps a person when making a decision.the last one is that i made a good decision. one day i was playing basketball and this guy got mad because i blocked his shot. after i blocked his shot he wanted to fight me. so he came after me, he laid a punch on my chest. it hurt pretty bad. i wanted to fight him and punch him back so badly because i wanted to stick up for myself. then, my friends who we were playing with said,""don't punch back it is not the right thing to do,"" so i didint punch back and i walked away and went home. i was ok, but i had a big bruise on my chest. that is an example of how multiple opinions from others can help you make better decisions. if i would have not walked away, we would have got into a big fight. so, i am glad that i walked away. my parents were very happy as well. always make the right decision and the good choice not the bad choice.i believe seeking a lot of opinions will help you make better decisions in life. seeking multiple decisions can help you succeed in life, it can also help when making a decision and, lastly i made a very good decision in my life. always seek a lot of opinions before doing things that they are not sure about.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

508DB90F68C7,"i think using this technology in a classroom would be a huge breakthrough. teachers wouldn't have to work as hard to figure out what he or she needs to do to help a student learn what they need to learn. this technology can tell what their emotional state is when in the classroom. if they are bored they might not like the way their teacher is teaching them. so the teacher can modify the way she teaches that specific lesson, so that the student has a better attitude toward that subject.this technology can also help councelers talk to the students that might be having personal problems like bullies, or family issues at home. kids wouldn't be able to hide their emotions as well with this techlology being in every classrom. for example with a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major, and another muscle called the risorius. you cant download the software on a normal computer, so schools would have to pay for the device its-self. it would be extremely expensive but it would help many students in classrooms, or some that need counceling.humans perform this type of calculation every day, for instance when you ask a friend if they are ok, because they look depressed or angry. we can perform this calculation as accurately as the current technology we have now. for example leonardo da vinci used this type of calculation and knew exactly how her face needed to look in order to get the emotions he was looking for.in conclusion this technology has many benefits for students and children that need counceling for personal problems, and or family problems at home.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0

D4E3104E7591,"to assure students are continuing to learn over the summer, some schools assign summer projects. a school summer project should be teacher designed even though it puts more work onto a teachers part, but it is better than getting poor projects from confused students in the beginning of a school year. projects already bring stress to students, especially since its summer and all students want to do is hangout with friends or do anything school related. having a teacher design the project is both relieving and easier, because the student has a foundation of what to do, they meet the requirements needed from the teacher, and so that they do not waste time on a project that may not even be right.if the student has a based foundation of what to do to begin with, the project already becomes easier to do. with guide lines already set up, the student can continue forth and begin the project successfully. let us say it was a textbook reading and project based on the reading. students, for the most part, do not generally enjoy reading pages on pages on pages; however, if a teacher gives a blank statement about what to do, the readings become difficult for the student to comprehend. in a students mind, it can go many different ways to think about a project. having a teacher design a project base gives the student more to go off of instead of a teacher saying ""read these pages and submit a project by the beginning of the school year"" is not helpful. by giving a foundation of the project, the student can succeed and be more efficient.meeting the requirements of any project whether it is during the school year or outside in daily life is so important, because the requirements is where a person is scored based on their work provided. for a student, requirements are on a rubric which helps guide the way of a assignment or project. for an example, writing essays are difficult in a way of being confident in their work. usually reverting to guide lines given by the teacher help boost the confidence of work to submit. receiving requirements by a teacher give assurance to the student by being able to look and see if they have missed anything or gotten all requirements checked off. for a student, being able to receive such assurance relieves us of stress. the stress will always be there, but some of it would have disappeared.if a summer project was student based, a lot of students would be unsure and confused on what to do. students do not want to waste time on a project they have no idea what to do. it is both a waste of the students time, but also a waste of the teachers time by grading projects that are not correct. also, student based projects have a variety of choices and decisions on whether or not a project is good or bad. like if a reading was about a mall and how it effects the choice a student has on how to spend time, there are many directions a project could go from there. students as a whole could easily waste time on a project by procrastinating, but usually it is because they are not sure on what to do. there will always be a student who does not finish in time or even starts it, but those who try and do work efficiently tend to do better time wise. instead of wasting a student and a teachers time, it is better to have a foundation of a project given by a teacher than having everything be up to and decided by the student.having a teacher designed project is beneficial to both a student and a teacher. work gets put into from both sides, the teacher and the student, to produce an amazing outcome of a project that meets requirements, was time efficient, and also gets the idea of the project. if it were to be the opposite and were to be student based, it would have had a fifty to fifty chance of it having a good or bad project that could not meet requirements, wasted time, and did not get the point of the project. the sole reason of a summer project is to show a student learning, if the project was not good, the project had no affect on the students learning.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
0A6324CE9AD0,"when a person asks for advice it is most likely they're in a situation that is to confusing or difficult to the point where they don't know what the right solution or choice is. making choices in life can be hard. most times they'res never a right choice, but having different people to talk to help you find the best decision. i believe having different opinions when asking for advice can help someone make a better choice because of the different perspectives, the people the advice is coming from, and the multiple solutions gotten out of it.talking to different people and getting various perspectives in a confusing situation is helpful because it makes a person start thinking deeper because they all don't have the same opinion. different points of view can be very helpful because of the different experiences the people could have. for example, one of the person asked could've had an experience of being on the other side of a similar situation which could help you think what is at risk or what is gained. another person could've made a bad choice and learned from their mistake which can give a bigger in site of what is at risk and there could be another person who tells you the complete opposite and make you look at the situation in a whole other way. they can be a lot more points of view, but it helps think more thoroughly to find the best choice.when asking for advice the people asked also have an effect on your decision making. the people asked don't always have a personal experience or know what to say or how to help you. it is most preferred to ask someone who has experienced something similar or someone who loves and cares about you. for example, getting advice from a friend maybe not the best option because friends nowadays aren't always real friends and don't always want the best for you. getting advice from a parent or an older sibling could be a better option because they're family, they're more experienced and wise, and most likely want the best for you so their advice would come with the best intentions.another reason asking for different opinions can help someone make a better choice is the multiple solutions you get out of it. talking to different people helps come up with different paths you can take and helps predict the outcomes. this especially is needed in occasions where the situation effect their future. those decisions need a hard and deep thinking because you're never to sure what could happen that you can regret. that is why finding various paths and solutions is helpful, but it could be hard finding them on your own so that is why seeking for multiple opinions can help find the best choice to make.overall, i believe talking to different people when asking for advice and getting various opinions can make a positive impact on the choice made because of the different points of view given by the people asked that could agree, disagree, or give you in site on the risks or benefits and the multiple options and solutions obtained. also asking various people can help rule out the advice that wasn't meant to help you given by the people who don't actually want you to succeed or be happy. so i believe advice on choices, decisions, or on sensitive subjects should be thought through and decided carefully because regret it something someone wouldn't want to carry for the rest of their lives.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

B40DD5822E7E,"not everyone likes to be in extracurricular activities or have or have to stay after school. sometimes it can be tiring and it can put a lot of stress on you. that can really be hard on you as a kid. but i am here to tell you why we shouldn't have to be in extracurricular activities.there are many reasons why we shouldn't have to be in extracurricular activities. one would be that other kids might have things they have to do after school like dance practice or softball practice etc. so that would make it hard for them to be at both or have a miss one of their practices. two maybe some students just don't want to do extra stuff for school maybe after a long day at school they just wanna go home and relax or watch tv. another one could be that they just don't find it appealing and they can start lacking in it and not helping out in anyway. that is just coming off of personal experience.some other ones would be that some students will do it just to act up in that class. i have seen people that has caused so much harm to a class or a sport because someone made them do it and they really don't want to be there. if i was the teacher personally i wouldn't want a student on my team or in my class that it there just to act up. next, some kids will do it because their friends are doing it. you all want kids that are going to do it because they want to not because they see their friends doing it.others might be that they could be doing just to waste your time. personally if i want to do something i'm gonna do it but i'm not gonna waste your time but other kids don't ever think about that. another one would be that they might not be doing it for the right reason. most people that i have seen have got into something just to say that they are in not because they want to help they, just want to make their self look good and thats not ok. we can't always force someone to do something they dont want to do.i honestly disagree with this decision because there could be a kid or a select group of kids that like to start fights or want to harm other students. i wouldn't want to work in that type of environment where i'm scared to even ask a question. you all should let the students decide for themselves what they want to do. if you don't all the stuff that i told you might happen it might actually happen. you have to give us the chance to decide what we want to do in life.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

97249F8DF48F,"technology is always improving. from a simple toaster to a toaster that can make several pieces at once. this facial recognition is a new way of detecting the true emotions of someone. i think the use of this technology is useful to all students, parents, governement workers, and etc.facial expression does not have a set of rules you have to follow. for example, when someone is very angry, they might cry instead. in result, the computer might take it as sadness. most of the time, facial expressions are easy to recognize. in paragraph 2 of ""making mona lisa smile,"" it says, ""each expression is compared against a neutral face"" (d'alto 2). everyone has different neutral faces. most people have a good way of keeping in their emotions, making their face look blank.when expressing emotions, certain muscles are tied to certain emotions. in paragraph 3 of the article, the author says, ""... your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you're surpised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"" (3). most of the time when you are surprised, you raise your brows. also, when you are mad, you make a face, and tighten your lips.when in school, you can use your facial expressions to show how you are feeling. in paragraph 6, the author goes on to explain that, ""'a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' dr. huange predicts. ""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" several teens do not speak up when they do not understand something that was taught during class because they do not want to be embarrassed. so if you are at home, on a computer, you will not have to speak up you can just act the same, and the computer will change it to help you understand more efficiantly.in conclusion, facial recognition is a great way to get students on the right track in school. it can help the teachers decide if their teacher techniques are effective or not. also, facial recognition can help people understand how others are feeling in certain pictures. if someone throws on a fake smile for a photo, the computer will recognize that. many different emotions, have different ways it can be shown. the computers detect multiple emotions including: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness (3).",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5
B111395C3C6E,i think it would be bad to have community service. i choose this reason because some kids never have time to do anything and making them do community service would just waist their time to have fun. plus what if some kids have after school activities and must go to them then they would get in trouble. that would cause a lot of trouble in the school.if kids just went to community service everyday they would be tired when they got done causing kids to be lazy in the future and end up being overweight. then they would end up not going to work and jobs wouldn't be getting done. if jobs didn't get done then we wouldn't have any new technology and we would slowly die out of the human race. no one wants that to happen do they?if kids went to community service then their parents wouldn't really get to spend time with them because the kids would be working after school and they would be too tired when they got done working that they would go straight to sleep when they got home. they wouldn't be able to spend time at them on the weekend because the kids would want to have the time they could to play without having to go to work. then the parents would be sad because they never have any time with their kids and the family would slowly fall apart. that's another reason why community service is bad.what i'm trying to say is that you should not tell students to do community service. you don't know what they have going on in their lives. they could be a professional basketball player.,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

F245631F4D97,"the end of the school year has finally come, and you can't wait to be swimming with your friends and family, however , that day will not come. instead you are assigned your worst fear; a dreadful , hideous , and disgusting summer assignment. when all hope is lost your teacher gives you a final decision.""should the assignment be teacher made or student made?""a summer assignment is a chance for students to perfect their knowledge and make sure they don't forget what they have learned throughout the year.a teacher-designed project is best for the students , because the purpose of the teacher is to guide their students on a path of enlightenment through the education system, students are inherently lazy and will make an easy project, and it provides the teacher a bar for which a teacher can know how advanced their students are before they come to class on the first day.the teacher has an obligation for the county and the state, and it's to insure that students are prepared to become adults. an educational study at yale shows that students who go to cram school over the summer have a tendency to achieve a higher score on the sat compared to those of a self taught student at home. this is without a doubt, proof that a curriculum and or project assigned from a teacher is best to give a student to insure that they retain previous knowledge and can build off of it. with the teacher giving a direct projection and project on what a student needs to know also helps the student, because the student doesn't have to aimlessly ponder on what the teacher wants them to know next year. it allows students to have a narrow and direct line of sight to their goal , and enables to teacher to have a direct overview on the project.students are inherently lazy and result to the easy road rather than the challenging path. if a summer project was student-designed the project, would be of the most basic and rudimentary work a students would want to finish it as fast as possible. as seen in the daily lives of generic_school students, in which 65% take non honors or ap level courses. we can see a trend that students are not willing to challenge themselves and would not be capable to create a project, in which the project would be academically sufficient for their studies next year. furthermore it can be shown on a global level in which the united states is ranked within the top 15 but not top 5 based on educational levels. if we as an american culture can't rise up to be a leading power in education with the help of our teachers, how can we expect student-designed projects and studies to do any better.a teacher-designed project will allow the teacher to know what level the students coming into the class are capable of. the generic_school system as had tremendous amount of trouble in which teachers have to ask for multiple planning days. the reasoning for this is due to the fact that students don't knowing the fundamental requirements for a class when they walk into the classroom on the first day. this causes teachers to have to readjust their curriculum in order for the students to catch up to where the teacher wants them to be. a teacher-designed project would allow the teacher to tell the students the basic information they need to know before they come into the class, it also allows to students to prepare their mentality going into the school year.the development of human society as a whole is told by its children and those who can help cultivate the young. teacher-designed project would provide students a strong foundation for the year to come, it stops students from being lazy and wasting their talents, and helps teachers formulate a more precise teaching curriculum for their students. these examples alone show that summer projectsneedto be teacher-designed to insure the betterment of the young generation. now how will you answer your teachers question will you stride to be the best you can and take on the teacher-designed project, or will you crumble under your own feet and take the easy route and design your own project risking your grades next year?",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

D26C9B0368D0,"no, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. there is a lot of action students have to take from being home school.for example the state has to make sure their doing their work instead of sleeping and lacking around. you have to be responsible and be aware of your work. i'm not saying all students can't attend online classes at home, but most cannot.going to school helps you learn and understand things better. if you dont get something, you can ask for help and the teacher can explain the problem to you. you also have a person teaching you instead of you reading things by yourself and trying to understand. being in class accurate and up can keep you from falling asleep instead of sitting around at home eating and sleeping all day. in addition of other students because i can't speak for everybody, some students can handle that and learn way better on their own than having somebody teach them.school groups is also another reason how student learn faster and better. working in groups help you learn more from other students. other students may know more than you or you might know more than them, which is a good thing. everybody has their own ideas and opinions. you can't forget some students are antisocial and like to work alone. if you are one of them people, than working alone and at home is best for you because you have nobody around to bother you.another reason being home schooled isn't a good idea because you have to be responsible. doing your work, making sure you up, and making sure you finishing it on time. you have to make sure you get up on time, not staying asleep to long, or staying on your phone. being at school you have to get what you need done, at home is like you know what you need done but you can do it later. which makes you lazy, staying at home eating,sleeping,and playing on your phone makes you lazy. its gonna make you forget that you have school to do. on the other hand some students are responsible. they know what have to get done and they get it done with or without any one telling them what to do or reminding them.school is learning place where you come and get your knowledge from. every parent should put their child in some learning program where they get taught not taught on their own. school is the most popular place in the world. getting a education and great job is good reasons why you should come to school. great job equals great money. good education equals a high advance in getting in wonderful colleges. with out school you life won't be to bad but you know you can live a way better live with school.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
088C3E8EBAE7,"dear state senator,i write to argue in favor of the electoral college. the electoral college is as it says on the 3rd source ""widely regarded as an anchronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidates who receives the most popular votes the winner."" that was in my opinion pretty self explanatory. this letter is based on information from article sourses i read.first of all, i would like to start by saying that the electoral college is helpful to avoid problems where no candidate got a majority. for example in the 5th part of the source 3 it says ""nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both  had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively)"" which backs up my claim. i understand the ""wrong"" part of it like in the 2nd source it says ""if you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [john] karry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry."" meanning voters vote for a slate of electors and they choose the president. honestly i dont see it as that ""wrong"" but thats my opinion.second, i agree with the electoral college despite the lack of ""democratic pedigree"" for five reasons. first, ""certainty of outcome"" meanning winning candidate's share of the electoral college exceeds his share of the popular vote, example, obama vs romney. second, in the everyone's president part it says that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, for example, ""romney was in the south, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win"". number 3, ""swing states"" the ""winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in [2012] election-to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states"". there is also number 4 where the electoral college ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution"" amnd there is number 5, ""avoid run-off elections"" which is what i used in the second paragraph as a claim.in summation im in favor with the electoral college for many reasons. after reading through this side and the opponing side of the argument i can honestly say that i prefer this method as it is. yes there is a bad side to it but there is a bad side to everything and it shouldn't be big enough for anyone to oppose it. well thank you for taking the time to read through this.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
52233E7A7574,"helping the community is a good thing, but people don't have to do it if they don't want to. but students should help out the community. i think since that we live in a good/bad community i think it would be good to help out the environment, or help younger individuals get a better education. other community services require like babysitting, donating food, or donate money, not all community services are long and time wasting.if all the students did community service, then the community would be way better for the young and the old. examples of a bad community for the young and the old would be like pollution in the air and on the ground, if everyone was smoking it would increase the chances of the elderly and young to get a lung disease like asthma. or if we left litter on the floor babies could eat the litter and could go to the hospital or even die.i recommend that everyone does community service even if the students don't want to, its good for the environment, the people, and the learning. if we did community service we would be a roll model for younger individuals and they would want to do community service as well and the cycle would keep repeating.though some of the community services we may do could be very dangerous. like picking up litter in the highway, some kid could walk out in the street to get a piece of trash then get hit by a car. i'm just saying that we don't use our heads sometimes.but what i' m getting to is that community service would be a great idea for everyone to do. and there maybe some risks to this also. if we did do community service more people would come to this town and that means more students and more money for the school! which means we could improve some of the things this school lacks, like more space in the rooms, and a larger cafeteria. the schools budget would be sky rocketing. so were pretty much doing each other a favor like a i scratch your back, you scratch mine.if people got word that were doing this good cause then the news would become an epidemic! more and more schools would start doing this making the world a better place to live in and there would be no more murder, robbery, or bullying. my point is, is that helping the community would be a great achievement for everyone.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

B6D776FC5087,i believe that yes we should keep the electoral college. to take it away would be wrong to me i have many reasons why and pay attention to find out why i believe we should keep the electoral college. i think it would probably be best if the ones who don't know what an electoral college is should really pay attention because i'm going to explain what it is to all of you reading this.to start off why wouldn't you want to keep the electoral college to me that's a sign of are freedom. the ones who don't know what an electoral college is we will get there soon just stick around. i am arguing that yes we should keep it because its important. the electoral college is the right to selecting/voting for president and vice president and people like that. now to began on with the reasons i think it is important is that's a sign of are freedom to me that gives us a right to vote for who we want running this economy. not being able to vote for this kind of thing could be bad because when we vote for the people we want running this economy we are choosing wisely because we don't want this town or anything to come crashing to the ground because of some man or woman who really doesn't care about the people they just want their name to be heard.some may disagree with what i've had to say but they clearly didn't think about it to much. also some people really don't care about who gets elected they just don't care nor do they wanna vote at all and most don't. when someone votes to me that's a good thing because we have went through all this freedom stuff and then were able to vote and no many people want to vote that's pretty ridiculous if u ask me that's a sign of freedom like i've said before and when we go through a lot just to get u this grant of freedom and people just throw it away that's a sign of disrespect. i know that me being young and not able to vote yet and probably not making any since at all is probably making who ever is reading this mad but i wasn't put here to be taken right back out at a young age i was put here to live a life that was chosen for me and when people who are to dumb to realize it don't vote or at least don't try makes me mad because their not seeing what there doing just going in there and putting what ever name down on a ballot is wrong but going in there knowing a little information and choosing the person you think would make a good leader is fine.people wonder why are world is so messed up and they don't realize it but its messed up because we made it messed up we had the choice to make it better but we chose to make it worse see taking away the electoral college is taking away are rights to make are community a better place and no one sees it but the ones who actually care and who are with me on this. people could show me a million articles on why we should do away with it but i will still agree with keeping because we didn't come this far as a community to just throw it all away and let people who don't care take away are freedom and rights to helping the community out and choosing wisely about are world and trying to keep are community as clean as possible and as safe as possible.well you have just heard my argument on why i think we should keep the electoral college and not do away with it because some people just don't care. i know that who ever is reading this could think differently about what i had to say and they may be saying this fourteen year old has no idea what shes talking about and they may be right but i know that when my time comes to be able to vote i will be there and i will be choosing who i think will be the best and i will care.,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0

61A0FEA827E4,"greetings ,my name is generic_name. i go to generic_school and i'm a junior this year. i was just recenlty informed that some schools require students to complete a summer project in order for thme to contiue to learn. but now the questions arises, should said projects be student designed or should the teachers design it? although some would say teacher designed projects are better because the teachers have an understanding in the topic and can provide accurate deatils for better clarity. actually i believe student designed projects are better because students could develop working enviroment skills and could make it relativly easy.by a show of hands who likes summer... because i sure do. shouldnt summer be a time spent learning or accomplishing other activitys like learning to drive, learning to bake or even learning to maintain a source of income. student designed projects would be easy and short something that could be done in a short time spand.not something that requires me to look up, double check for accuracy, cite sources, revise,noodletools, and then hope i dont forget about it or lose it. students know students best, plus it could develop skills for future planning because of course not all of them are going to be the same, some will be easy and others more challenging it can be a brand new experience for the students to design and for the teachers to look upon their ideas.another side to look at is if a teacher designs a project soley online. what if i go to a place with no internet? how am i suppose to do so if i cant access the document? well theres nothing i can really do but, if students design a number of different projects some could be on papar and others online that way i could get options on what i'd be ok doing. for example some could be just to ""read a book""or some could even be creative like ""draw a place you visited while over the break"". point is students have a greater imagination than teachers in most aspects and could make a varity or projects and not just stick to the same one for everyone.now for a story. in my entire life ive only had one summer project and it was back in middle school. the goal was to just read a chapter book and then to write about it. that year i had read all 6 of the star wars books from ""phantom menace"" to ""the jedi return"". but i decided to write about ""revenge of the sith"" which is my favorite book/movie from the prequel era. i honeslty didnt know how to start the writing ,as a surpirse to no one i was and still am a pretty weak writer. but eventually i came around to write about anakins insecuritys and the fact no one was honestly there to help him through his dark time and that it consumed him even making him hurt the ones he loved. now keep in mind i had finished about a week into summer so i was pretty much free to do what i wanted. that same summer i had traveled to honduras for 2 and a half months to visit. but as soon as i returned school was satrting and i had completely forgotten about the assignment and to put the icing on the cake it was lost.i believe student designed projects would be better for its simplicity and for all the groups involved to get a new experience weather its the manner of grading or designing it. wouldnt you like to have more time to enjoy your summer break or would you honestly prefer a harder time doing whatever the teacher mightve brewed up while on their free time?",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

04147BBED91A,"detecting emotionsnew software has been developed that improves accuracy in percieving the emotions of others. the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could be valuable, or it could be a waste of time, depending on how you look at it.technology has been upgraded throughout recent decades, and most recently, technology has taken a different approach. the software is the latest innovation from prof. thomas huang, in collaboration with prof. nicu sebe. dr. huang and his colleagues are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate, but is this really a better way to communicate? it comes down to the facts. the computer constructs a 3-d computer model of the face, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. everyone has different ways of expressing emotions, and not everyone feels the same emotions. thinking that a computer could possibly detect your emotions is a bit silly, to some, and valuable to others. so what makes it silly to some? you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face, you can talk with them in person. having physical contact is very important when it comes to emotions, using a computer to detect, sounds a bit far-fetched. schools have teachers, and school counselors, so that students can talk express how they feel. some people don't see why this feature could possibly be useful in a classroom.there are many issues going on in the world, much worse than trying to figure our expressions. so, why aren't we using this tchnology, and these smart people to work on something more important? imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad, what would you need it for? human communication is very important, using a computer to detect how you feel is simply a waste of time, in some opinions. making faces can reveal so much about the science of emotion. on the other hand, what could the facial action coding system be useful for in classrooms? students may be able to use this feature in physiciatry studies. students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work. for instance, this new software was able to create percentages of mona lisa's emotions. the latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better. as humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes. most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile. the computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling. however, a computer cannot feel, cannot have sympathy, and cannot understand many things about humans. reaching the final conclusion is up to you. is a computer being able to identify your emotions useful in classrooms, or not?",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

0FADC137B8B7,"dear state senator,i feel a need to adress that changing election by popular vote for the president of the united states over keeping electoral votes is, in my opinion, better for the people because it brings the u.s's people together in many ways.the people of the u.s deserve to make great decisions like these, on account of the fact that us, the people, make most of what we have in america today, and though we work hard and may have fights sometimes, we still make choices together,voting being one of them, and this unifies us even more. allowing this will bring a sense of unification . we already consider doing selfless acts just to make peace. example: our taxes pay doctors', polices', etc. salaries. we at least deserve to decide who enforces laws.another thing, to begin this reasoning let this question be asked: what is the government doing right now, this very moment? who really knows, for sure? not us. the people of the u.s really haven't an honest clue what's really going on behind the government, so it wouldn't be too wise for us to entrust the government into completely making every decision, decisions in which we could perfectly make ourselves. so it not only gives us, the people, a sense of unification, it also gives a sense of direction so that we feel that we are not being blindly controlled by the government.to commence the third reasoning let another question be asked: first, say for example that you work a double-shift, full-time, day and night just to keep food on your childrens' and wifes' plate, clothes on their backs, and a roof over their heads. when the bills roll in, your paycheck isn't won't arrive for weeks and you still haven't enough to pay, so you may have to work overtime if possible or pick up another job. no one gets rich off the government clearly, and yet we work so hard to just make it. now here's the question: doesn't it all feel worth it when the paycheck come in? okay now for the deeper question: what is the sense or feeling you specifically get when you see you happy families' faces? now for the point: our work pays off. we work for the government (at least most of us does) together, whether to put bread on the table or otherwise. now wouldnt it give us that sense of freedom that us hard workers get to make great decisions like these? it would. all of these things bring us together more than we might even think, whether its families, friends, or just us as a nation.to conclude all of the reasonings of arguing to change election to popular vote for the president of the u.s which are the sensation of unification, direction, and freedom, i'd be obliged to state that this is just one thing that finally unifies and brings the u.s's people together. those three senses that this gives us is a seemingly small, yet great difference. and even though most don't realize it, it's definitely there.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5

294099CEB05C,"dear principal teacher_name,i agree with the terms that to participate in sports and other activities, that you must have at least a grade b average. although many students have a grade c average, i think it's best to follow through with this policy. it would help students in school, as well as make the teams and activities a more stricter, nicer team.students should have to have at least a grade b average to be on the school's sports teams or in any other activities. by doing this, the students at our school will be smarter and more mature. the student will have to wok very hard to achieve a grade b average and will have to study more. tests scores will go up and because the students want such good grades that they will have to pay attention during class; therefore, the students won't act out in class, as well as the activities they are in. they will care about the team or club and do their best. i think the policy for having a grade b average to be on activities at the school should be a yes.students with a grade b average will be rounded quite well, for they will have the smarts, as well as the athletics. everyone can make a grade b average, so this policy would not be unfair. it would challenge the students to do there best on every paper they turn in. the students would also learn new study skills, as well as fundamental organization skills that are needed in everyday life. if students could keep up with all their school stuff, study good, and keep good grades, then collage will be easier when it comes their time. it's proven that students that make the better grades do better in college and other activities, then the ones that make less decent grades.to have the kids that are in clubs or on sports teams that have a grade b average or better, they will have more smarts to carry out plays better. if the quarter back on the football team doesn't have the right fundamentals down, then the quarterback is useless. smarts also help in groups. for a student to have a grade b average, then they must have some type of leadership in them. so for a grade b average student to be in a club or something of that nature, then the group will have a better bonding. they will be able to work together and develop into a team or group. brainstorming ideas for ways to help the community will be able to be organized and arranged neatly.having the students maintain an grade b average at our school is a policy that should be passed.helping the students think for themselves, giving them necessary elements in life, and keeping them well rounded; this is what the policy offers. i think that the policy should be passed. it helps kids grow to be better adults, as well as help them in other situations in life. by doing the policy, it enhancing our generation, as well as many to come. instead of more and more kids just barely making the grades, they will work towards being the best student they could be. the teachers are happy, the students feel proud of their grades, and all the activities are filled with smart wonderful children, this is why the policy you are suggesting should be passed and should be started in our school.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5

F84CB4D0589A,i believe that it would be better to allow students to have their cell phones out during lunch or free time because many teenagers think that their cell phone is an extension of their body or something that they need and can not live without. if you let the students have their cell phones out during lunch or free time there would be less problems with someone texting in class.i think that the reason people are so dependent of their cell phones is because it is a quick and easy way to talk to their friends.i think if you do not let them have their cell phones there would be more problems with them texting or calling people in class because as teenagers we do not like being told what not to do or what to do.so i believe that if you let them use their phones during lunch time or free time but not during class would be a better solution then taking their phones away completely.granted a cell phone can be very useful during an emergency situation but not during the time your supposed to learn.but there are some drawbacks to allowing students to have their phones is that they may think that it is ok to use their phone during class. so i believe that it would be best to put the student's name on the phone and place it in a bin in front of the class so you can know that the student is not texting or calling any one in class while the teacher is talking and you can see to it that they get their phone back after class.that is why i believe that it would be wise to allow students to have their phones turned on during lunch or free time as long as the student has the cell phone turned off during class.by student_name,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
23011CDB368B,"dear principal,i believe we should have policy one , this is why, policy one seems fair enough for everyone because it allows you to use your phone at lunch and free periods (passing period) and some students might need to use their phone in case of an emergency. some students use phones anyways when it is not even allowed on the campus. in my opinion kids should be able to use phones as long as it is on vibrate or silent and they cant disrupt other kids or play music. i think they can use it in classes for a calculator or a timer, etc. policy two you cant even use the phone at all. i think each school that's thinking of having phones should do a vote with the parents and students, and have students write an essay on why they should have phones and if twenty out of one hundred students have a convincing essay about phones then they should be able to have there phones during lunch and passing periods. if this rule is abused then we get one warning then another warning and finally just not be able to have phone at all the third time you tell us to not have phones out during class. a lot of kids don't follow the rules at school but maybe if you let them have the privilege of having their phones they will end up becoming more responsible. i hope that we will be able to use phones at school and if we aren't able to have the phones at school right now than at least consider it later in the years. in my opinion and other kids opinions we believe that we should be able to have our phone during school. its something to think very hard about but what ever you choose people will respect your decision and maybe you'll even consider it later on when other kids are there and you are still the principal. i hope that you consider my opinion and take it into action. thank you for taking the time to read this letter.your student,student_name",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

CC06612E842A,"i think having every student be in a extracurricular activity is a great idea and i completely agree with the principal. students might not have any plans after school, but what would be better than being in a after school club with a group of your peers. or for athletic students they could be on one of the sports teams. having students be in a extracurricular activity is a win-win in every situation. i think students should be in at least one extracurricular activity because, it could help students with their school work, it can be a opportunity for students to become more social and make new friends, and it could help students get to know the school and staff and make the school a better learning environment.some students might need help in some of their classes. so because of that reason they could be in an extracurricular club like study hall or homework club. students could help each other master the material by reading it over with each other or quizzing each other on the material. if a student cant be with a teacher after school for whatever reason they could go to a student in their class for help. sometimes getting help from one of your classmates can be better than getting help from a teacher. these are ways students could get help in school from having extracurricular activities and have more success in their classes.by being in a extracurricular activity like book club or yearbook, it could be an opportunity for students to become more social and meet new people. some students could be quiet and anti-social but, by being in these activities they could meet new friends and people to talk to at school. they could meet those who they share common interest like video games for example and could bond over those things. or people who like sports and like to talk about sports. extracurricular activities can be a great way for students to bond and get to know the people they go to school with.being in these extracurricular activities students can get to know the school and staff better and make their school a better learning environment for themselves and others. some students might not know a lot of information about the school they're attending. but with these activities students can connect with their teachers and staff on a deeper level and get to know them more. this could also help them in the classroom. by knowing more about their school they could contribute to making their school a better learning, safe, and fun environment to be in. this is how being in an extracurricular activity can help students get to know their school, the people that work there, and make the school a better environment.i think having every student be in a extracurricular activity is a great idea and it should be implemented into the school. there are a lot of great things and opportunities coming from this decision. it can help students more than just academically. it can also help them socially. they can connect more with their school and make it a better place. in conclusion these are the reasons i agree with the principal and i think all students should be in at least one extracurricular activity.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

3EFA3EE80C51,"dear principle,community service is a great way to help today's communities, and also a way to meet new people. however, not all people would want to do this. i personally think that community service is a volunteer job and that people of the community should do it at their own free will. depending on what type of services the students would provide would vary the response in enthusiasm. my opinion to community service would be that every one needs to do their share in helping.most students are very compatible and can be convinced to do something that might not sound fun or appealing at all; but when it comes to adults putting in their share, they normally don't have the time to do so when they have work. i think its up to the youth of today to keep our communities in good shape. maybe after school programs where students and friends could get together and have fun either cleaning up or help younger children or elders. snacks and trips could be given and make community service less than a job and more of a hobby.requiring students to do community service would get things done faster and more efficiently rather than asking them to do it on their own time. for example, if you ask a random student, ""would you like to help me pick up trash?"" they are most likely to say they have something better to do. if they were told they have to, it would get done and if you added something that is entertaining to that person they are more likely to come back and help again.community service can be done by any age group. taking a group of 7-8 year olds to a park to pick up trash would be one of the simple was to teach the younger age group that their a part of this community. later they can go play on that playground and enjoy themselves. 10-15 year olds could help teach the younger group or head out with their friends and help out at the schools, any age higher could do the same.there are many ways to help, and many people to do the job enforcing students to do that job would be an complete positive to our community. i think when i get a chance i will do community service within my neighborhood and with my friends. the smallest of jobs can make a big impact.sincerely,student_name",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

6E154A9B7943,"phones & drivingtoday, the majority of adults own and operate cell phones on a daily basis, such as, texting, calling, and being on social media communicating to one another. but while using a cell phone while driving in the other hand is utterly dangerous. first of all, you're not supposed to have your cell phone out when driving in the first place! this increases the risks of an accident, and worst case scenario, death. anything can happen if you look away even just for one second off the road.to begin with, let's talk about our senses really quick. we use our eyes to see, ears to hear, hands to touch, tongue to taste, and nose to smell. when we are driving we mainly use our eyes, ears, hands, and feet. we use our eyes to see the road, as well as other cars. for our hands we use the steering wheel to maneuver the vehicle, and our feet we use the pedals to determine the speed. lastly, we use our ears to hear our surroundings. for example, if we were going to make a call/text on the cell phone, you will lose all of those abilities, because you are distracted doing two or more things at once.in addition, the hands free georgia law states, ""all drivers operating a motor vehicle on any highway of this state are prohibited from: holding or supporting, with any part of the body, a wireless telecommunications device or stand-alone electronic device."" this emphasizes that the driver is not allowed to write, send or read any text-based communication, including a text message, instant message, e-mail or internet data, according to the georgia department of driver services.lastly, this goes for the same as drinking and driving. any alcohol consumed inside your body will greatly be affected in your driving ability. the alcohol rehab guide claimed that, you'll have a ""slow reaction time, lack of coordination, reduce concentration, decrease vision, and inhibit judgment."" these are ways alcohol influences you, and your driving capabilities. on to the dangers of using cellphones while driving. the general cell phone statistics reports, ""that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the united states is caused by texting and driving."" these are numbers people need to start realizing that your life is more important than being on your phone communicating to someone else when driving.in conclusion, using your phones while driving is prohibited. based from these reports, there were evident factors to the point that cell phone use while driving does cause accidents. therefore, that's why we have laws to prevent these irresponsible acts. together we can end these numbers if we just take more control in ourselves.",3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5

1F56575F6388,"principle,i believe that cell phones should be allowed in school at lunch time but if you have them out during class you'll receive the normal punishment. what would be the point of not allowing students to have they're cell phones out during lunch? they are eating and/or talking to friends.although, the only true downside to this is if your texting it does not always get to the other persons phone right away, depending on the amount of signal you or they have it could take 5 seconds or it could take 30 minutes. and because of that the students cell phone could ring in the middle of class and end up having them in detention with they're phone taken away.so as you can see in the first two paragraphs that there is a good thing and a bad thing about allowing students to have there cell phones out during school hours, or at least class room time, and with that being said why can't we also have our cell phones out during school dances, it would not be very different from lunch time and your after school. the only problem i can see by allowing this is if you drop your phone, leave it somewhere, or its been stolen.these things are not very big things to worry about but some of these things don't really have a complete point to, like the one for school dances in the last paragraph, it doesn't really have a reason why we can not have them out. truly there has to be a really good explanation for not allowing this.now for not allowing them in class i understand, the way i see it is because students will, most likely, most of their time texting or calling friends or family about what they are going to do after school. if this is allowed the this will probably happen, the students will not pay attention, they will not learn, won't get their homework finished, they might get held back a grade, not graduate, not go to college, won't get a very good job (that they actually like to do), from then on their are a few more problems and all because the school allowed cell phones in class, but that doesn't mean that this will happen to everyone some will actually want to pay attention, finish homework on time, and so on. but luckily schools don't allow phones out whenever the student wants to text his/her friend but maybe at lunch or at school dances.now throughout this response i have said/typed what i think is, in a way, best for the school and that is to carry out with the no cell phones in school policy. because the student might lose his/her cell phone or other electronic device.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
CE5D744B6D39,"making decisions can be difficult when people don't have the confidence that their thinking is the best choice. this is why, when making important decisions, one tends to seek multiple opinions from others. seeking multiple opinions help make a better choice because one can look in a different perspective and can consider the best options.looking in a different perspective can help people make better choices for themselves. specifically, this is because having a new perspective can provoke more options for people to choose from. seeking more advice from people with different thoughts can lead to more choices that one can consider. this is helpful because there is a bigger chance to have ideas that would make better decisions than the other. also, one can consider things in a new way that they haven't thought about. if people are stuck with the one point of perspective that they have, this would not lead to another way of thinking. however, listening to other people for advice may help people to consider things in a way that they have not yet thought about. therefore, the new way of thinking can turn things around into an opposite route of the original. another example is that someone can propose an option that is better than you. never think that you have the best idea, because there is always another creative mind that can think in a different perspective. one should get advice from these type of people, but continue to seek other opinions that may be better than the last. it is always useful to ask multiple people for advice because everyone has a different perspective that they look through.other people's opinion can be the key to deciding on the best option. first, it is important to ask people for advice because one can get multiple useful suggestions. if you have a handful of ideas in your mind, then you can ask people for the best options and why they think that. this would help people to carefully consider the options with actual reasons that support their answer. additionally, one can make improvements to their thoughts. by getting advice from people, one can figure out what they are lacking. by knowing what has to be revised, they can make improvements to their thinking. one would also be able to gain knowledge from people. it is possible that others know more information about the topic that is being considered. from gaining new information, this could also help figure out the options that would be better overall, when considering the new knowledge into the decision. when trying to find out the best option that is on the plate, it is helpful to ask others about their opinion.considering the best option and looking into things with a new perspective can help people make better decisions. it is important to carefully consider all the options that you have, and a great way to make sure is to ask others for advice. asking others about their opinions can clear up your path and help you easily make your choice.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

69A1A0E6B176,"my principal has decided that all students are required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, and i think its a great idea! extracurricular activities are actually a great thing for students to get involved in for many reasons. requiring all students to do extracurricular activities results in students either getting more exercise or using their brain more depending on what they choose, and it will make them more likely to get into college. students who were skeptical of joining anything extracurricular will finally understand what its like to be a part of something like that and i think most of them will enjoy it.students engaging in activities that require a lot of physical activity such as sports, will be more physically fit and most likely healthier than those who do not. if someone decides they want to sign up for yearbook or student council, they will have the opportunity to greatly improve their problem solving skills. anyone having engaged in either of these will understand what its like to work with a group of people to work together to achieve a common goal. this will allow students to better understand how to exist in the real world and how to work at their future jobs.anyone who does an extracurricular activity and in this case everyone going to my school will have a better chance of going to college. colleges see if and what you have done in terms of extracurricular stuff, because they don't want someone who they think will do the bare minimum and barely get through. colleges care about their image. so as far as the colleges are concerned good students equals good looks and good looks equals more demand college which equals more money. part of that image is sports, in fact if you are good enough at a specific sport so much that they want you to be on their team they will pay for you to go to their college, this is called a scholarship. the better the students a college gets the more attractive it looks, the more students my high school sends to college the more attractive my high school looks and the students have a higher chance to go to college, its a win, win, win!i feel that it is important in high school to be a part of something like a sport, or yearbook, or student council. the sense of community and common interest in a large group of people can really make you feel at home and be a nice thing to look forward to after a long day of school, even if it might be taxing physically or mentally. in anything extracurricular everyone knows everyone, they're all friends united by a common passion and a common goal. this builds strong compromising skills and cooperative skills.the principles decision makes kids do something that they will most likely actually really enjoy, something that will very much assist them in getting into college, and something that will allow students to understand how to survive in the real world. it will also benefit my high school and any college any current student at my school goes to in the future. in conclusion, the decision to make all students required to do an extracurricular activity was a fantastic one.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
41CC238F5738,"why students should not be forced to take an extracurricular activity.so picture you're at home, burdened with homework, rushing to get it all done and all of a sudden, your parent gets an email from the school saying that every student will have to take one extracurricular activity. your parents are worried because extracurricular activities are expensive, how you'll get to and from that activity, and your school work. how fair is that? it puts stress on you and your family. don't get me wrong, extracurricular activities are great for growing teenagers, it can be a great safe space for them, but why should they be forced to take one?they are really expensivesome popular activities are dance, martial arts, sports, and music. which are all very expensive. they are great extracurricular activities to do, but so expensive, and not all parents can afford them. for dance, costumes are at least $100, dance shoes vary on quality, but are usually expensive, dance wear is about $30-$50 per piece, and makeup, lots and lots of makeup. plus, you usually have to know how to sew, and if you don't already, you might have to add the expense of sewing classes in there. see how they all add up? that's about $230 for just costumes, dance wear and shoes. let's say your parent is a teacher, the average teacher makes $65,000 per year which isn't that much. some even make $35,000 per year, even less. and to have school expenses, plus that, that's a huge chunk of your parent's paycheck. some parents have to use that money to pay rent or mortgage, heating bills, water bills, electricity bills, and extra things like clothes, and food. that doesn't give them that much of a flexible amount to spend. some kids prefer to save their parent's money, plus if they dont want to take one, that's even more unfair.they won't be committed to itlet's say the options the school provides are all not of interest to them, so they're forced to take something they don't want to do. how would you like to be forced to commit to something you didn't want to do to start with? i'm pretty sure no one would want that. though extracurricular activities are great for students to do, some are just reserved and are shy when having to do things in front of people. for students with anxiety, that is extremely embarrassing. plus, if you force someone to do something they don't want to do, they'll just do it with half-effort and that makes everything one step harder for the people who actually wanted to do that activity. i can almost guarantee that this will happen if schools force students to do this, and it'll just make the activities less fun for the ones who actually want to do it.they may have other things to doso as we all know, in middle school, there's a lot of homework, even more so in high school. a lesson is usually about an hour and a half long. school ends at 3:30, so they'd get home at 5:00. 5 or 6 is the most common dinner time, and it usually lasts about 30 minutes. that's 5:30. then, they have to go and try to finish their homework. if they have a lot of it, it can take a long time, and can usually lead to them putting off important stuff, like personal hygiene (gross!). they're probably super exhausted from their activity, and just want to take a shower. but nope, they have to do the rest of their homework. depending on how much they have, they could end up staying up really late. highschoolers can usually end up staying up until 3 am in the morning doing homework. that makes them more tired and not ready to focus the next day. it could've saved them so much more if they didn't have to do the activity.so how much is forcing students to do an extracurricular activity really saving them? i feel like if schools force students to do an extracurricular activity, they will see lower test grades, lower participation rates, much more attitudes towards them, and more tardiness. this behavioral change will be because of the time wasted on things they don't want to do, and less sleeping hours. though extracurricular activities are great for them, dont force them on people, because instead of helping, it's actually hurting.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

BA0183CB23C5,"people all around the world go through different things, but it's those who are there with you that help guide the way. in times of a tough decision, seeking multiple opinions will help in making a better choice. everyones opinion gives a different point of view and can help pick out what decision is best. as well as, some people have gone through similar things and can help talk out the situation. in my lifetime i have experienced my friend go through a rough path. because of the people who helped her, she is now happier and living much better.many people will have different perspectives. they all can influence a decision, because everyone is different. we are raised by our culture and environment. therefore, no two minds are alike. situations are seen differently, giving an abundance of different solutions. imagine a parent and friend helping out the same person, now compare the two. as a parent they want what's best for their child and try to look to steer them in the right direction. while a friend may want the same thing, but at the end of the day they are looking to have fun and may not always give the best advice. when people are getting someone else's a opinion they are making themselves vulnerable to the fact that different possibilities could happen. people can get strongly judged or rejected on their opinions they've made, as that could heavily impact a choice. however, getting multiple views on a decision is always the best option, because everyone sees things differently.throughout our life people have been through hardships. some may be similar situations which include ways it's been dealt with in hopes of others making better choices. with the help of someones past, it can help pave a way for someones decision. knowing peoples mistakes and consequences can differ what others choose to do. when making a choice some people visit professionals. a few include psychologists, therapists and counselors, they help listen to a problem in hopes of breaking it down and seeking best possible outcomes. these people are there to help drive a path for healthy decision making. another reason is that knowing other people struggle with things too and that no one is ever alone. it provides at least a little comfort understanding everyone goes through something. those people who decide to open up about their problems can also help determine a choice. most people care for the well-being of people in hopes for a successful and enjoyable life. talking to people who have dealt with similar problems or people who are professionally trained, can help bring ease to making a decision.at one point in life everyone has gone through or knows someone who has been through a tough decision. a couple years ago i had a friend who always gave advice to everyone's problems. she was beautiful, intelligent and fun to be around. however, she did not feel this way about herself. as time went on some situations became too heavy to handle, the stress grew on top of her. at school she only showed perkiness, meanwhile, she was in a darker place. no one was aware of this until a few weeks later when she spoke to her friends, then counselors, next teachers and eventually her parents to get the help she wanted. she was afraid of what the world would think of her if she wasn't perfect. these people all helped her find ways for comfort and how to get the treatment needed without doing something harmful to herself or others. she was steered back into a safe and happy pathway thanks to the help of those around her.to finish off, when seeking multiple opinions it can help someone make a better choice. as said in paragraph one, throughout life people have different views on situations and how to resolve them beneficially. as restated in paragraph two, people in life are faced with many challenges. knowing others struggle can help bring together different ways to handle a decision. lastly, when my peer was faced with a problem she sought out help, this brought her to a happier place. she is now better than she ever thought she could be. making a decision shouldn't be done alone, we need to use the people around us to help guide our journey.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

5A3BABA1AE21,"i agree that some schools should let students do summer projects sometime over the summer. my main reasons are: staying active, not being lazy, and keeping your brain and yourself on track . during the summer you should want to go out and enjoy the outside world, you can do other things as well and to be creative about things for your school summer project, other than staying indoors and deciding to only sit around and do nothing.first, the reason i said to stay active is because when you are outside you never know what you will find or discover if you are doing a project, or just simply exploring the world or the envoirment you live in. discovering new things helps you think about nature and physical activity that is happening all around you. if you are doing a specific project, then maybe you should look for certain things outside, or even think about what would be great to add on to your project. stay focused and try to look forward into new things that you see for your summer project.secondly, for my reason of not being lazy is mostly saying that instead of being at home watching television commercials, or being on your phone all the time, maybe even just sitting and play video games is way worse than enjoying yourself. you could be missing so much fun things that are just waiting for you to explore with outside. it could be new animals you never seen before, something interesting that you might want to experience or hanging with friends. they can even help you on your project to if you want them to join as well. don't just sit around and put boring things on your project, or words that dont make any since to you or the topic of the project. you want to be creative with your ideas think positive about finding new things and most importantly ,have fun with what you are doing.although, you might not be lazy but you must have your brain and yourself on track at all times. school projects are made for you to have fun while doing them, and to meet new people if you are working in groups , or even if you are by yourself and still have positive thoughts for you and your project then everything its going just fine. you must make sure that you feel comfortable to do your school project and to have all the things you need to make your project creative, strong, and well written. over the summer, you want to go places to enjoy your self and not to sit around and be off tasks all day long.this section might be a little off topic but i just wanted to say , whatever you do over your summer break is up to you. you can be outside having fun or maybe even inside as well enjoying yourself. some people would not like to do a creative project outside sometimes but that is okay as well because you can do your project inside too. a lot of times, projects can be for fun or just to be graded when you come back to school. while you are doing your project, it helps you learn more over the summer break and you become interested to do certain things over the break and thats fine to. being creative is another way of saying, you got this no matter what.in conclusion, have fun with your project. don't be afraid to do anything with your project that mainly talks about you or what you like to do in your life. doing projects makes kids want to do them more over time, and then they might just might, be able to describe many things specifically for their projects. learning on the other hand, makes you think more than just to not think at all. just remember, while you are doing these projects once again you must continue to have fun with them. tell about your life, family, or other and to have a great summer as well.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

89AB334EE7ED,"dear principal,i'm writing this letter to inform you on my thoughts and positions on requiring students to perform community service. i would first like start by saying that community service is a great thing. without a good community and those who help we have no community. i agree that students should be required to perform community service. community service teaches the youth of the importance of having a strong community. it also teaches how to take care of our community when we grow up. another strong point is to give back. as kids we get everything we want without giving back. lets show the adults how well rounded are communities youth is. by doing things as simple as community car pooling or just picking up garbage we decrease our pollution in the air which would make this a safer place to live. students such as myself should be assumed to help the community out, also we shouldn't be rewarded with material things for helping our community. reading to kindergartner's should warm anybodies heart. knowing that we made some sort of a difference in our community is reward enough. principal i think i've made my point clear. are youth should have to perform community service. it wouldn't take away all our free time and it would help our community in so many ways.sincerely,student_name",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5
2D8C767B44E7,the question is electoral or election. well i choose election because the election is a better way of letting the oters express their ideas. in such ways as they could compare and contrast. they could also pick wich one they think is the most proficiant. unlike the electorals they choose the people that will decide the president so there for they could and may lie to the judges and tell them a certain thing but then do a different thing that is also a well asked questions.electoral could have a positive outcome sometimes as such it can have a negative outcome. election can also have positive and negative points. but i think that election could have a better chance of succeding because of the voters. stated in paragraph 11 says ( the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.) well there we have it people are already questioning that choice. some proses that ties that vote could and may not be acurate.election also has some bad features like some might say its the most basic level but it also is unfair in some ways. that statement or opinion is based on each individuals point of view. we dont all look at the choices in the same way. that is very important to try to undestand each choice and look at them closely. to be honest i think both have good ideas but election has a better outcome from my point of view.electoral or election. i say election both are extremely simialar but also very different. deciding a president is very important in any situation. the outcome of choosing then turning out that it was a miss understanding is very ploral. we have to put the outcomes of both out there and examine each and every one closely.,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5
0BC016A285DC,"dear teacher_namehear are some of my thoughts on the change of school policy on raising the grade average on sports. most students have a c gpa lower of higher. my opinion on this idea is good and bad. one of the reasons that this is a good idea to me is because it will probably encourage kids to work harder on getting good grades in school so they can play the sport that they are interested in. then one of the reasons why it is a bad idea is because if the gpa on sports is raised, some of the kids that may have lower grades in school, they might think that having good of grades like that might be not worth it to play a sport causing the numbers to possibly decrease.over all i think this a bad idea, i think it would be better to leave the gpa for sports at a grade c average because a c grade average is not low but still good enough to the sport or sports that the student wants to play, it would be easier for all of the sport playing students and all of the ones in the future.sincerely,student_name",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
C9083A6A4955,"dear principle,i am a student at our school and i have some thoughts on the polices that you and the school administrations will be imposing over the next weeks. it is my belief that it would be in the best interest of all the students and teachers if no cell phones where allowed during school hours under normal circumstances. i think this is the correct option because, while at school a student's mind should be on the work he or she has been assigned and the job of keeping his/her grades up. cellular devices are a distraction from school work and assignments they keep a student occupied with social activities and interaction rather then the grades and assignments that the student has been assigned. also a cell phone is not only a distraction for students but a hazard. imagine if you will how hard it is carrying all your books and other school related items without distraction then amagin your cell phone going off in your pocket, of course you answer it but while pulling the phone from your pocket you trip and fall. it is much easer to fall and drop books or food while talking on a cell phone.there is however one exception to the general rule of no cell phones. that is in the case of an emergency, such as a fire or a hostage situation. since these are risks that must be taken into account. i propose a compromise between the two extremes. student should be allowed to keep there phones on their person as long as they are turned off at all times during a regular school day. this then creates the problem of students texting during school hours and class so i propose that students who are caught texting or using the cell phone during school our not in the case of an emergency should have there phones took away for a set amount of time. much like if a student does something wrong he/she is punished with a certain amount of time.i thank you for taking the time to listen to my thoughts,sincerely, student_name",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5
25C5C068B05E,"people ask for advice for many things that they might struggle with most people are able to help by just giving them their opinions. some people ask for advice and opinions in topics such as school, work, and sports. it is important and completely healthy to ask for advice or help.when should you ask people for advice or their opinions? you can ask whenever you might need it or want it. for example in sports, work, and school. you can ask anyone if they ever need advice. with something or someone, and you can help them by just listening or talking to them about it. and mainly try and understand what they're saying or what they mean about it. it can also make them feel more confident and better than they did before. and asking multiple people is also good so that you get more opinions that could help you.writing and essay in school can be very stressful and difficult. but you can help someone in school by giving them advice on a essay that they're stressed about or maybe just need some help. another is taking a test, taking a test is very nerve racking and scary but all you might need to do is just relax take a deep breath and talk to someone and just stay positive. games in school are fun but someone may need help with a question to get the answer right. if anyone might need help maybe just go over it with them and re-read it so that maybe they can understand and get it quicker, and get the answer rightin work talking to your boss for any reason is very difficult or scary. one because you never know what they might say to you it could be good news or bad news which is always hard. a good topic is getting promoted or something very special at work that could boost your confidence into wanting to keep improving or doing better. getting a big part at work is also very exciting and you might want to talk to someone about that just if you need a confidence talk on what might be going on in the future at work or who might be there to help guide you through everything that's going on.in sports learning new things or skills is very hard or maybe it might be easy for you and make you want to keep improving. pep talks are also a very good way to figure out what coming that your coaches might be preparing you for in the future or before a game or your about to preform. being nervous is a huge part of playing sports because you never know what might happen or what could happen so all you need to do is stay positive and ready to improve.overall it is very important and very good to ask people for advice or opinions so that they have an idea about whats happening and it overall just makes them not as stressed and nervous. so whenever you think you might need help or advice with anything dont be shy or nervous to ask everyone needs advice or an opinion at some point in time in their lives. so just ask in the future and dont be scared to ask.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

E8CA56DE95A2,"making a choice is not always an easy thing to do. wether it's tyring to figure out what you should order on the menu, or a bigger decision like which college you should attend. however big or small the choice is, there are always people around you that can help you find the answer and give you their input on what you should do. asking for the advice of people you trust can be really eye opening. seeking advice from multiple people can help you make your decision much more clear and help you make a better choice. sometimes, all it takes is a few people's input that will impact your life.talking to multiple people about a decision can help someone make a better choice because if everyone you're talking to is saying to do the same decision, then your choice becomes a lot more clear. if you seek advice from many people, and most or all of those people are saying the same thing, then the choice becomes much more clear. for example, if you're debating wether or not to take all honors next year, and all of your teachers are telling you you should do honors, then the choice to take all honors becomes clear. seeking advice from only one person might not make your mind up as quickly as talking to many people. having one of your teachers telling you to do all honors might not be as impactful as having most of your teachers telling you to do all honors.another reason why talking to more than one person about a choice is helpful is because you can recieve new options that you haven't even thought of before. talking to multiple people can make you think of new ideas on what to do. if you are really not sure about a decision, people can show you many paths of which you can go down. having another option can make your decision even more clear. for example, if you're deciding over going to greece or italy for your vacation, and other people you talk to are mentioning paris, you might consider going to paris instead which you haven't even thought of in the first place.another reason why talking to multiple people about a decision can help someone make a better choice is because you can learn from people's past experiences. learning about people's past experiences can really change your perspective. if you're talking to multiple people about wether to do something or not, and those people say not to because it didn't go well for them in the past, then the choice to not do that certain something becomes much more clear. for example, if you're not sure if you want to go cliff-diving, and the people you talk to are all saying you shouldn't because they got hurt while doing it, then the choice becomes pretty clear to not go cliff-diving.talking to multiple different people about a decision can be very helpful because you can get different point of views. getting different point of views and opinions can be helpful sometimes because it can make you think totally different from what you were thinking before. it can lead to new paths you want to go down. though getting different point of views can also be tricky sometimes because it can make you even more conflicted then you already were. but a lot of the time, different opinions can lead to more options and oppurtunities.getting other people's input on a choice is important because if you're really split on a decision, the people you seek advice from might make the choice a lot more clear. if you really trust the people you seek advice from, then your choice should be made easily. there's nothing wrong with seeking advice from others sometimes. sometimes making choices on your own can be very difficult and all it takes is other peoples' different opinions and point of views. you might just need to hear that advice that pushes you into the right direction.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5

FE3CA06DDCA1,why is it when someone asks you for advice there the one's talking most of the time? here are 2 of the reasons i think that the person who asks for advice talks more than the one who is giving the advice. reason 1 is they might want to give the on who is giving the advice all the info so then they can help them. reason 2 is that they are give you as much detail as they have to give you good advice.they will want to give you all the information so you can probably find a solution or fix to there problem. as in this sit ions where my friend needed some advice for a test she had coming up. she was not sure what to do to study for it. she was telling me what she had to study but then she said ãâ¨ i donãâ´t think these would help me muchãâ¨ i told her to make flash cards out of the note she had then she did that. she was super stress. i think when your stressed you just say things that are on your mind as in you talk more.if a person wants good advice they will want to give you all the details. if you know all the details you will most likely know how t fix it. everyone needs so good advice because the how are they going to fix there problem. if you friend has a problem and they dont tel you all the details your not really gonna give then good advice.in conclusion why you need advice you will talk more then the person who is given you the advice. when you are in a problematic event you will take a lot more because yo will be most likely stressed. also if you give all the the details of your problem you will get good advice.,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5

F8A06DB4A5CE,"the electoral college system is better than the popular vote system because every citizen should have a say in who is running the country they are living in. also, if not everyone has a say in who their president is there would probably be claims of discrimination towards the government for not letting those people vote. there would,as well, not be a standard that could be set that everyone agrees on because the people excluded would not accept it. popular vote hasnt worked in the past and it wont work now either.if we chose the popular vote system it would never work out because there would always be people,mostly the ones excluded from voting, that would disagree with the system in general and the standard set on who can or can't vote. for example,in colonial times only white men who owned land could vote and i am sure that the african americans and the women and even the white men who didn't own land were not too happy with that standard. of course if we had the popular vote system today,the standard would definitely have to be changed but the people who are excluded wouldn't like the system at all.in the electoral college system everyone who would like to gets a say in who is running their country and pretty much nobody has a problem with it. it is also much easier to count the vote's of 586 votes from the electoral college than like half a billion from cictizens in america. another two reasons that the electoral colege system is better than the popular vote system.in the colonial times there were slaves and only 1 out of every 4 votes from slaves counted and that was very discriminative but it was how it was back then but think,if we adopt the popular vote system, what would happen if only white and black people could vote or only white men. there would be udder chaos in america and there would be wrongful deaths and crimes. i would get mad too if i was put in a spot where i was not allowed to vote but some people would take it to the extreme and it probably wouldn't stop until the standard was amended.in conclusion, the popular vote system is all around a bad idea and it would cause nothing but bad times. keep the voting system the same because everyone seem's to like it so dont fix it if it's not broken. that is why we should not change or fix the voting system in america.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

FA49F4D9E6A8,"online classes have been around for some time now, in fact only some schools offer this learning option by taking certain classes online or video conferencing. online schools can be taken because of different situations; such as, being home schooled or having to retake classes. there are reasoning behind this idea of online education that could help students in different kind of ways that i'll be writing about. how can online education benefit students from taking online classes from home?although most schools have normal education such as regular classes at school, other schools have something else in mind. other schools have online classes that students are able to attend. i think the reasoning behind these online classes are because some students may have it difficult at school. the majority of kids that are home schooled or take online classes are because of what goes on around them at school. kids may not feel comfortable, not being able to get along with the people around them, and having trouble learning. kids may find online classes a better way of education by concentrating and focusing more, rather than being distracted by other things around them at school such as kids disturbing them and the drama that goes on between students. also, some kids, including me, may not feel safe at school because of the things that have been happening to other schools like school shootings. school shootings have happened a lot around the world, because of situations like that, it leads students to not feel safe at school. another reason a student may not feel safe at this school is because the way the school handles certain situations. like every other school, there are drills, like lock down drills or fire drills. some students may not want to go through real life drills and they fear a real one could happen.coming from a student , i support online classes. i support online classes because from my point of view it could be a solution to a lot of things to what goes on during school. a few other reasons why students take online classes are because a student could be getting bullied. in some cases this is true, a student may not be getting the best education at a regular school because they're too scared to even go to school. at times, parents end up taking matters into their own hands by protecting their child from bullying and finding a solution like online classes. another example on why kids may be taking online classes are because of what goes on in their life. kids my age on social media that are influences are busy with the media . they create content or focus on other things in life that may not fit with a full schedule class at school so they choose to take online classes that way they learn on their own time and have time to work on their social media life. lastly, failing a class. in some situations, students end up failing a class or classes and end up having to retake these classes online. also, online classes is a great idea because it could help prepare students for college. some students in college take online classes and do most of their work online, which will help the students that are still in school get prepared for college.overall, i dont see why online classes would be an issue; as long as you're learning and getting the same education as you would be getting at a regular school then everything should be alright. although online classes is a topic that should be discussed between parents and the school, students should have a say in it as well because after all, it is apart of their education. my thoughts on this is that all schools should give a chance to have online classes because as i said, some kids may end up liking this way of education and learn better! i'm glad other schools have given the opportunity to let students experience different kinds of education. yes, online classes may not work for everyone but in my opinion it is not wrong to take these online classes as long as the student is getting the education they need. i hope other schools get inspired by these online classes and give students a chance to try it out, because after all, a students education is what's most important.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

5C5EB17E8684,"when you ask for a person's advice on a choice, you may hear a different answer than the last person you asked. that is because of their perspective of the choice. when you hear a different perspective of a choice it tells you how the people may have experienced a problem related to yours. you can learn from those past experiences, figure out what went wrong and if nothing did go wrong, then see how you could make it better. it really helps when you know the background of most people's experience related to the topic. you can piece together the information, or write a list of the pros and cons of each perpective and combine all the pros. finally, when you have your idea of all the perspectives you now know which choice you or others could most benefit from. the choice could now help benefit all kinds of people, since you understand the perspective of all people big and small. asking for multiple opinions is a probably the best way to find out how to choose the best choice because all opinions matter.the choice you make can effect anyone in a negative way, although you may not be aware of it. that is why you should ask for an opinion(s) for it. you don't know what will happen when you make that choice and who it's going to effect. depending on what choice it is, it may effect people's daily lives. what most people don't like is change (especially if it doesn't benefit them). the choice you made could change the routine of the person's daily life, they may have more to do or his or her schedule could be way different than before. when you change something about a person, there could other people who depend on them to do something but they can't because of the choice you made. it could be a policeman or a firefighter that has his or her schedule changed, then somebody needs help but the policmen or firefighters aren't doing his or her job right now. lastly, all of this makes you look like a careless human being. all humans judge based on a person's first impression, it wouldn't help if you ruined everyone's lives. it's like the butterfly effect, or like dominos. if you didn't care less about just asking one more person for his or her opinion, maybe this wouldn't have happened.the choice you make can effect anyone in a positive way, because you were aware of everyone's opinions. that's why you should ask for an opinion(s) for the choices. you might know what will happen when you make that choice and who it's going to effect. it's all in your control. depending on what the choice is, it may effect people's daily lifes (in a positive way).` what people do like is changes that benefit them. the choice you made could change the routine of the person's daily life, they may have less to do on their time or maybe something that they are offered that could be nice. there is usually emergencies where someone need help from a fire or a robber, but you could prevent the disaster from happening. finally, all of this makes you look like a caring human being. all humans would be grateful for the time that you have sacrificed for a beneficial choice to all, because you asked for multiple opinions, and you understood. this has all happened because you cared for others opinions. this is why it is best to seek multiple opinions for a choice.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
649B2A197C4A,"dear senator,if you were to question u.s. citizens about what an electoral college is, what would they say? most of them don't even know its a process established in the constitution in which electors ""vote for president and vice president,"" and then are counted by the congress (source 1, paragraph 1). they don't realize that their votes can be over-riden by these votes. and those, if the very few, who do get it, are opposed. they would prefer another system, a more modernized system, and are disgruntle about how unfair the system is, not only about how the electors are chosen but how the larger states have an advantage in votes and in information.most voters are opposed to such systems, according to source two, ""... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now,"" (paragraph 9). yet we still have the electoral colleges going. as active voters in todays society, we call for a fair system. we want, no, we need, to be treated fairly and not over-riden.we need a system us as people can control ourselves. as in source two, i will ask you the question, ""who picks the electors in the first place?"" certainly not the citizens as a whole, most of the time its picked by the state governement in some shape or form, but sometimes, even the presidental candidates themselves can pick them (paaragraph 10)! as well as in source three, where its clearly pointed out that ""... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people,"" (paragraph 15). it's outragous how easily they can pull the wool over our eyes, and even worse how we let them. but no more.as you probably already know, each state's ""...entitled allotment of electors equals the number of memebers in its congressional delegation..."" (source one, paragraph 3). most represntatives spend most of their time campaining in places like new york and california that the small states such as rhode island arent even visited. ""in the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see candidates at all..."" and that campaign was refered to as a ""fiasco"" in which the electoral college caused a dispute (selection 2, paragraph 13).  this leaves the smaller states less informed and more likely to vote to the exact opposite of what they want, and yet they still have as much say in the vote. in selection three, it is said that the swing states (or larger ones) ""... are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates),"" (paragraph 20).selection two points out something very important that should be stressed, ""... each state casts only one vote, the single representative from wyoming, representing 5000,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 represantatives from california, who represnt 35 million votes,"" (paragraph 12). this shows the citizens aren't really being represented properly.altough many downfalls, ""the electorial college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states... lose"" and ""avoids the problem of elections in which no one recieves a majority of the votes cast,""(source three, paragragh 21 and 22). yet still there can be holes poked in that, and all though unlikely, theres an even amount of votes so the vote could be split 50/50. just imagine the chaos we could be thrown into.therefor, as a concerned citizen speaking as the voice of others, we demand a better system, for a simplerly system, for an equal system, for a system we can control ourselves. we demand for a direct system! so i ask, please, for you to speak to your friends, and speak out for your people, and put an end to the electorial colleges.sincerly,a concerned citizen.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0

5B9A44B2CF80,"in the passage the author suggests studying venus is a worthy pursuit desite the dangers it presents. in the first paragraph the author says ¨venus, sometimes called the evening star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.¨. in that quote it is saying that the evening star is so bright that someone is not really paying attention could see it because it is so bright it can not be missed. it is also saying that it is one of the brightest points of light which means if you are lost you could look up and hopefully see that star and it will give you some light to find your way. another quote from paragraph one is ¨however, this nickname is misleding since venus is actually a planet. in our solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun¨. this quote means that even though venus looks like a star because it extremely bright, and shows off an extreme amout of light it is a planet. many people mistake venus as a star but once they find out it is a planet they are amazed because of the brightness of it. in paragraph two it says ¨often referred to as earths ¨twin¨, venus is the closest planet to earth in tearms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance to earth¨. in that quote it is saying that venus is known as earths twin because of the size. the earth and venus are about the same size. it also says that earth and venus have about the same density as each other. in my opinion i think that the planets should all be different sizes and densities because of the fact that everything is different. when it comes to planets they should all be different sizes, so that people can easily point out the planets and be able to name them easily and not get them mixed up because of them looking the same size in the atomosphere. in the passage in paragraph three it says ¨a think atomosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankes venus¨. in this quote it states that most of venus is covered in carbon dioxide. if scientists wanted to go study venus they would have to have many layers of protection on because carbon doxide can be very harmful to the human body. especially since the carbon dioxide percentage is so high it can extrmely hurt the human body of anyone that goes to venus to study it. my thoughts on this topic are that if they want to study it they should send up a professional to put something on venus that can dectect any movement or anything on the planet. they should do that so the scientists wanting to study venus can study it from a safe distance and out of harms way.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

572236CAAFCE,"why do nothing, when you can do something that will help you no and in your future?students should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity.the principle's choice to have every student to do an extracurricular activity is a good choice because students will get to connect with others who have their same interests, students get to meet kids that they normally wouldn't meet just in school, and students will get an example on what it is like to work with a team or group.first, it is good for students to participate in one extracurricular activity because students will get to connect with others who have their same interests.people that have your same interests are different than people that you hang out in school.you hang out with people in school because they have the personality that you enjoy to hang out with.but, people with the your interests will understand you better and you will always have something to talk about.the people in your group will talk about the same things that you do.for example, a student wants to join the soccer team, and he doesn't know anyone.the student can is always able to talk to his teammates about soccer because they are on the same team.then eventually, the student will no longer have to only talk about soccer because he has finally fit in to the rest of the kids.finally, the kids that have the same interests as you will also be the people that you will talk to the most in or outside of school because you like to talk to them about your sport or group.next, it would be good for students to do an extracurricular activity because they will get to meet people that they normally wouldn't meet when you are in school.joining a team or group will be nerve racking at first because you might not know anyone that share the same interests as you do.but when the team/group finally gets to talking, they will have bonded so that nobody could break them apart.it is important to get those types of relationships because if you ever need help to do something, then your team/group will have your back no matter what the problem is.in school, you choose who your friends are, and once you have your group, nobody else is allowed in.but when you join one a sports team, the student council, or the yearbook staff, then you set aside your school friends and you allow yourself to gain different friends.people that you once thought were ""weird"", or ""annoying,"" are now your friends because you realized that they actually have the same personality that you do.finally, it is important to do at least one extracurricular activity because students will get a taste of the real world in having to work as a team to get things done.if students don't get the opportunity to work with a group, and to work as a team, then they wouldn't be prepared for life when they are older.learning to work with people is one of the most important things you need to know how to do.so the sooner that you start, the better the future that you will have.if you don't know how to work with people, then the path that is in front of you is rough because nobody will want to hire you, nobody will want to work with you, and nobody will have sympathy for you.nobody will hire you because they will look at your back round and see nothing in you that will help them in their work space.nobody will want to work with you because you will be mean and do little to no work.finally, nobody will have sympathy for you because they know that you had every chance to be successful, but you chose not to be.most people don't want that, do you?in conclusion, it would be smart for the principle to implement that students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will get to connect with others that have their same interests, students will get to meet other students that they wouldn't normally meet in normal school time, and the students will get an example on what it is like to work as a team and to prosper at doing your work.starting with an extracurricular activity now will not only help you now, but it will help you later in life too.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

7B5D27D241EA,"dear principle,in my opinion i think that all students shouldn't have to participate in community service, because some kids have important things that they have to do, not want to do, have to do. for example what if a student had siblings that were younger than they were and couldn't take care of themselves, so their older siblings would have to take care of them. then the student couldn't take care of their community service hours. another is what if a student participated in sports and had an important game to go to. that means that they couldn't finish their hours as well. another example is what if students had a big test to study for and it was worth half of their grade, then they would have to study instead of community service. that also means that another student could not fulfil their community service hours. it's not just three or six students that could not fulfil their hours. the whole class would have to study for the test and more that six students have younger siblings that they have to take care of and finally, more that six students participate in sports or other extra curricular activities which means that all of those students could not perform their given community service hours. since they could not perform their given hours then they would have to face the consequences even though it wasn't the students faults. they had more important things they had to do, not want to do, had to do.if they did something bad to get in school suspension or out of school suspension then they should have to perform community service but not without and independent reason. that is my position on whether or not the students of the school district should have to perform community service or not.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

202A2848311C,"schools are not only about learning math, english, science and history. schools are also about learning how to interact with other people, and if a student does not attend school they will be behind those who do. i think online classes would not benefit students in the social aspect of life and in performance in academics.during anyone's time in school whether it is a private school or a public school they encounter other students which helps develop social skills which are important to survive in the real world. the online schooling would not only make those who take it feel like their alone but it will make their adult life far more difficult. in the real world, future adults will have contact with a lot of people and students who had an interaction with other students will have an easier time doing so in their adult life. unlike kids who spent their time in a room all by themselves learning, they will have to adapt to having interactions with other people. for example if a student who took the online classes in a future job had to present something for his boss, the student would have a difficult time getting his point across to other people because of the missing interaction with other people during their developmental years. now if a student who attended school with other people did this it would be much easier for them because they would know how to talk to others and get their point across.another reason is that some kids learn better with others. sure there may be the usual kid that does not want to be around other people but there's not many of them. for example my friends and i enjoy coming to school because we see each other and also because it has a sense of competition in terms of who has the better grades. i think when other kids are around and doing better than you it makes you want to try harder. second if a student you sat next to in math class or in history was doing better than you in your mind you would say, oh i want to be like that, making you want to try harder and ultimately do better in school. in any competition teams push themselves to the limit, whether its a race, the final of a championship game or the last play in the game, teams try their hardest because the other team is doing so as well. students will do that too, but they need other students to compete with which would not happen in online school.the last reason why online schooling from home would not benefit a student is because they will simply skip the class. no matter who you are, you have your lazy moments. you have those moments where you just don't want to do anything, these moments usually happen at the comfort of your own home. times like this are easily avoided by attending school, the student wakes up in the morning gets ready, walks to their bus stop and off they go to school. a student who has class at home may or may not forget about their class or even worse know they have it and decide not to do it because they are at home. there is no choice in whether you will go to school today or not, most of the time it's a yes, your parents say you have to go to school and that is what you have to do. online classes can be avoided if the student just does not do it. students are supervised in school at all times whether its administration during lunch, or by a teacher in class. who is going to supervise the student at home? if a parent is home they might do it but if there is no parent it's up to the student to make that decision and its usually a i am too tired to do this.online school may be only fit for a certain amount of students. for example students who work or live too far from a school may be able to benefit from doing it, but the majority of kids would not. online school has its wins but it is also very faulty. it can be easily be avoided by lazy students, it can have a big impact in the future of the student and it can have an change performance in a bad way. therefore most students will not benefit from online school and it will slow them down.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

A66B5A9D1F00,"people ask for advice, because sometimes they can't make the choice on their own. it's also not a bad thing to do when you are stuck and need some advice from other people. when people make choices on their own and don't ask anyone for help, they tend to make a bad decision. some people feel trapped when trying to ask someone they trust for advice, because they are scared about how they are going to react. so then they don't ask them and then the problem they were trying to solve turns into a even bigger problem then before. then at the last moment they decide to tell or ask the person for advice when it's already too late. sometimes it can create another problem that they are going to have to solve, or it solves the problem. asking one person you trust for advice is something people do more often than asking multiple people. but there is also a problem when asking only one person. if you truly trust that person, but they don't give you good advice who are you gonna ask then. the only person you told your problem to was that one person, so you don't have multiple choices like when you ask multiple people. plus, what would happen if that one person you trust doesn't what to help solve your problem, there is no one else you can ask for help if you don't ask them for advice. also, if you ask multiple people you can see their advice from their perspective. this would mean you would have a large variety of choices to pick from.advice from multiple people is better than asking advice from one person. if you ask multiple people for help with your problem then they will give you multiple ways to solve it. as for if you ask one person for help they may or may not give you more than one way. for instance, if one of your friends give you a solution but you don't like that solution and is trying to do another solution, then you have those other friends you can ask. you aren't limited to how many people you can ask for advice. some people can also go to a trusted adult, and ask them for advice with the problem they have. but sometimes people don't do that, because the adult mite take the situation into their own hands and some kids mite not like all the attention they are going to get there are good things and bad things about asking multiple people or just one person for advice. the good thing about asking one person is you don't have to really worry about them going around telling that much people about your problem. but with multiple people you have to remember who you told and tell them no to tell anyone. if you also ask one people and it gets to an adult, then you would have to explain your problem to them even if you didn't want to. then word would get around that you snitched to a teacher and then thats how bulling starts. so if your going to tell a teacher, say it anonymously so no one knows who said what. you also don't have to worry about getting bullied when you keep it to yourself. but sometimes, people can't do that. after you ask the people you wanted to ask for advice, your going to have to make a decision. before you make a decision, you are going to have to think of the consequences. consequences are the outcomes of your choices that you decided to make. there can be good consequences and then there can be bad ones. the bad consequences depend on the situation that you are going to be in or is already there. you have to think,"" if i do that what is going to happen. is it positive or is it going to be negative."" normally, people always go for the peaceful choice so their can be less problems. people also make choices everyday on what to eat, wear, and when they should do their papers.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

C8C708EC29F7,"why students should participate in extracurricular activities. you should consider doing a extracurricular activity. because participating in at least one extracurricular activity can help you branch out, make new friends, and you can have access to currier interests. these are very important because they can help you have a overall better experience at school. many enjoy doing these activities and find it very relaxing to get away from school for a while and try something new.firstly, you can branch out and make new friends, when participating in extracurricular activities. when you are doing something you enjoy, you can find people with the same interests as yourself. many people like myself love doing extracurricular actives. for example i love doing ffa, i've met so many great people along the way. this organization has taught me so much, such as life lessons, leadership skills, and team building strategies.secondly, this is a great way for students to interact with others. in addition they can participate in sports, working on the yearbook, and the debate team. sports, is a great way for you to get the exercise you need, becoming more social with others, and being competitive with other teams. working on the yearbook is a great way for students to take pictures, edit on computers, and take part in the making of the the yearbook. finally the debate team, this club is for students who are very opinionated, strong willed, and are not afraid of public speaking. this club is great for students who enjoy arguing against others and communication well with other teams.thirdly, currier pathways options, this is a bonus to participating in at least one extracurricular activity. you may decide to try something new and really enjoy it. in the future this could possibly be a currier interest for you. for example if you choose yearbook, a currier option for you could be photography. there are many options out there, but this one extracurricular activity you choose, could help you make that decision. on the other hand i would think about choosing one of these activities.in conclusion, you should consider doing at least one extracurricular activity. you can branch out,interact with others, and have access to currier interests. these activities can really make you more skilled at what you love to do. therefore i encourage you to do at least one extracurricular activity.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

E3E50332E6FD,"sometimes we need advice, and asking one person for advice just doesn't provide you with the right advice you are in need of. when we ask more than one person it can benefit us, because each answer is so diverse and it is seen from a different perspective. when its one person, you only hear their bit of advice, and sometimes you need a little something more. so, lets jump in so i can tell you how getting advice from more than one person is better than just one.advice is a very important thing that everyone needs in their life, at least once even if it's for something good, or something bad. adivce can change our take on things, because it can change the way we do things, or not. we get the best advice when we ask more than one person, because you can look through someone elses perspective and see how they see you, and how you act. sometimes you get a various amounts of good advice, and some bad advice. when you ask more than one person, you can get a lot of good feedback therefore, you could have a lot good advice to use, whcih is another benefit of asking multiple people for advice.sometimes to recieve good advice, it is all in who you ask, because maybe asking people your age or younger may not be the right people to ask but older people may be the right ones, and vise versa. here is a good example of asking one person versus many people for advice. when trasforming from child teen, we need advice about what's happening and what to do and what not to do. in this case older people would be the people to ask, because they have been through it and they probably have made the same mistakes as you, therefore that would be their expertise. for younger people you could ask advice on what clothes to pick for school and other easier things that they'd be better at advising you with. you can always ask as many people as you want, because everyone is different, and different people have different answers that can help you out.not only the age of the people you ask matters but how they act. if they are a bad influence on people, you should definitely not ask those types of people for advice, because they could lead you in the wrong direction. look for people you know will be helpful and who will try to point you in the right direction to get you on the right road. stray away from asking mischeveous people, and go for people who try to do good things. asking a lot of good people is better than asking bad ones. it is always good start with adults when asking for advice, because they were kids once too, and they may know a lot even if they didn't grow up in the same generation. many grew up differently, and the different responses can come in handy.in the end we realize asking multiple people for advice even if they are young or old, is the way to go, because it will benefit you the most. whatever the advice you need may be, asking many is the beneficial thing to do. so next time you are in need of advice remember these key things to look for and follow, then ask away. remember the more people the more answers, the more you'll understand the advice, and the better decision you will make. this is why asking multiple people versus one is the right way to ask advice.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

82223F37DDCC,"in this passage ""making mona lisa smile"", the author made very detailed and valid points about the use of technology detecting what our expressions say about our moods, but, technology reading students facial expressions is over the top. i belive that this new technology would force students to always want to force a smile so that the computer doesn't fully recognize their real from their fake. in this essay i am going to tell you about my opinions on why i think that this new technology is bad for anyone to even have.first, i would like to say that this is a really good topic the author brings forth to the table, but who would want to feel like their being watched? ""for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. but if you frown, the next ad will be different."" this information is truly invalid. smiling at an ad does not make it appear the next time you get on a different website, and frowning at an ad doesn't change it either. it's the way the ads are set up that it makes them leave or come back. student's shouldn't have to feel like they have to fake their emotions just so that the computer doesn't recognize how they feel in reality. i do not believe in this ""new technology"" that seems to be changing the way we see ourselves. i would not want kids to feel like they are being watched or even judged on by what they look like through a computer screen.lastly, i would like to say that this point of view that the author is taking is a very good start, but thinking about the author feels versus the way every one else would feel puts this topic on hold. not every one wants their child to be watched through a computer screen that's looking at their faces to show how they feel. if some one is happy on the inside but frowing on the outside then how would the computer sense that? sometimes we hide our emotions on the indside and show neutral expressions to everyone else outside of our hearts and mind. computers can only detect what they see and not what is actually going on. that is why i believe that the value of using technology to read students' emotional expressions should be forgotten.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0

E243F4B2D0FA,"dear senator,according to the articles and arguements given i think the most effective way to get a premeire president for our nation is vote on the behalf of the electoral college. in my view of the electoral college has more experience aswell as having a sense of quality and values that they know can change the country.if we depend on the popular vote of the country,only in the favor of the people classes and opinions of the people, it may lead to presidents that cant maintain order of his or her country.nonethless,the votes of both electoral college and majority vote is basically as lucky as a flip of a coin,one side may lead to ultimate failure and the depression of a country the other may lead to momentous uprising of the country,in chosing the right leader of the country.although, based on the criteria i just created is really puzzling your mind about what president is best i believe that the electoral college may clear things up and make the best decision in favor of the people.based on the articles,the electoral college does knows best because although they lack of democratic pedigree doesnt mean there wont be democrats in the whitehouse, because they have requirements of how to find the best fit no matter what party included.even if they were unsupportive of the democrats romney lossed as example of equality of parties on the college's choice.the articles also state that no popular votes determine the election of a president showing that although more than half of the population in the nation picks a candidate it wont matter unless that candidate gets a majority vot of the electoral college aswell.stating that the expierience of the college will prevail on the birth of a new president,no matter what party,no matter the odds of a popularity vote, the electoral college is a perfect example of this nation's motto because they are truely a sign of equality between candidates that might become great presidents of our nation.sincerely,proper_name",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5

309BE8E1DCF1,"dear teacher_name,i disagree with the idea of only letting students with b grade average or higher only being allowed to participate in schools sports. it is unfair to all the other students that were one point off from a b point average or those who didn't get those a' s or b' s. it will make all the other students fell left out, or feel like they're being excluded. i find this new idea unfair and i don't want it to become a rule of school.to start, it can make these students that didn't make a b grade point average feel like they're being excluded. ""don't exclude, you should always include."" this is what teachers have told my fellow students and i for years. i think it is unfair to not let everyone compete in sports. these students that didn't get a' s or b' s may be the people who always wanted to compete in sports, but never had thought to join or never had the guts to stand up and join the teams, but if you introduce this new rule, then they don't even get a chance to try. i think this new rule is unfair and it shouldn't be kept.also, not everyone is perfect in school, and not everyone gets all a' s and b' s. i've had only a few c' s, but the rest of my grades were always a' s and b' s. one little c could ruin any students chances of competing in school sports and representing their school. i don't think schools should judge kids on their grades by letting the grades decide if a student can participate in sports or not. according to this new rule, a student can have all a' s and one c, but it's not the a' s that matter then, it's that one little c. don't let this new rule prevent any student from competing in sports.lastly, sports provide any student with what they always need, confidence and exercise. if you let a student's grade decide if a student can or can't compete in sports, you can be holding them back from healthy exercise and keep them from building confidence. exercise keeps students healthy and when a student competes in sports, they are exercising. every gym teacher i've ever had has always told us how daily exercise is important and i've seen many commercials that say growing kids and teens need at least one hour of exercise each day to keep physically fit and healthy. sports also build confidence. when a team wins, it boosts a person's confidence. when you are confident, you feel that you can do anything and succeed. sports provide healthy exercise and confidence to students, but if you keep this rule, you'll be depriving it from us.so what do you think? do you want to exclude students and make them feel like they're not good enough to participate in sports? do you want to deprive us from healthy exercise and confidence? please consider the consequences of keeping this new rule. i feel it is unfair and i strongly disagree with it. i don't want anyone to feel left out or worthless when it comes to sports, but do you? thank you for your time in reading this letter. i hope you consider the consequences.sincerelystudent_name",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5
8BA0BFC49C4F,"to the principle,the policy i think you should put in affect is the first policy that allows students to have their cell phones in school but it cannot be present or used during class times. i choose this policy because it seemed reasonable. from pass experiences i found myself in situations where i needed to use my cell phone and i wasn't able to. one reason why she shouldn't pick the second policy the one that says no phones at all is because of safety. what if one doesn't take the school bus and left their t-bus money home how are they going to reach their parents and tell them they have no money? little situations like this can happen everyday and this may cause frustration among parents and guardians.the second reason is because the second policy is just unfair. from the pictures i've seen in the video not all the students were on their phones. some were actually doing their work so putting policy number two would just make innocent people suffer. school is a place of learning new things and experiencing things you wouldn't at home so if students want to text and talk on their phones i say, let them because their futures are in their hands and if they want to talk to their friends and text about what boys they are going out with or what they are doing after school i think that's their problem.take it from a student, most rules are broken so i really doubt students aren't going to stop bringing their phones to school for example in our school gum isn't allowed but students continue to bring gum and chew it in school the rules and the detention doesn't stop them. but if you make something reasonable and fair maybe the usage of phone doing school hours will stop. it's 2011 thing are changing many teens and now kids have phones. i'm pretty sure the reason their parents bought it for them is for communication, with them i may add. so if you take that away who will they be able to communicate during a emergency. yes some students misuse their ability to use phones but you shouldn't everyone.student_name",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
BBDA39C84AF7,"having different opinions for advice is a good thing. if someone asks multiple people advice on a problem then the outcome would be their is different answers for different people. when they get different answers from different people then they can narrow the most logical answer from the different people. finding multiple opinions is the best way to correct or enforce your idea or create an idea. that is why having multiple opinions on a subject is a good thing.if you go up to one of your friends and ask for some advice. then, you ask someone else about that same advice. after you will probably get a difference in opinions. although it is good to have multiple opinions your not always going to get a straight answer. like if you ask someone something that they are well knowledge in, and someone who is least knowledge in. who do you think the best person to ask about that subject is would be. the well knowledge right well not entirely just because they are well knowledge about it does not mean that they are experts in that subject. the less knowledge person could know something that the well knowledge person does not know so that is why having multiple opinions is not entirely good.when someone gets different opinions on a subject then they will try and narrow the opinions down in a logical manner. like if someone has 5 candidacies and they ask each person separately a majority of the candidates will have different answers. so, if someone has both of the same answers then the person who is asking will probably lean more to the similar answers. just because the people go towards that answer doesn't mean that it is logical.if a person has an idea or needs an idea about something they are going to want to get advice about something. if they have an idea then they can either change the idea or enforce there idea from the different opinions. if they don't have an idea then they can get ideas from the peoples advice. that is why having multiple perspective of an opinion is good.giving advice to people can work because of a difference in opinion. if someone has a difference in opinion or a friend has a difference in opinion then giving advice and explaining it thoroughly can really help someone. like if someone asks a friend to give some advice to them. then talking about precisely what they are looking for can help to expand a brooder view on how that person can help there friend.having a difference in opinion, to find a way to decide on different opinions, giving advice, and deciding on changing or enforcing ideas. it all has to do with how having multiple people giving advice is a good thing. though sometimes having a difference in opinion it is not perfect it is not all that bad to have different opinions. who ever asks can narrow the idea which can enforce or maybe change the outcome of the idea. they can give advice because of having a difference in opinion. all of the ways of having advice of multiple people can all help each other.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5
952CB87D4897,"in the vast idea of being right or wrong, an individual can easily be swayed or unsure whether something is just the way they wanted it. in this case, and many others, seeking outside advise or help can solve this problem. not only can seeking help create a better understanding for the person who was unsure of something, but it can also relieve stress and anxiety, which is a major component of a decision about to be made. also, a further benefit of asking for outside help, is for the well-being of others. if this decision could affect the lives of other individuals, its only common sense to be one hundred and one percent sure before making that decision, and what better way to be one hundred and one percent sure than asking the advice of others.seeking understanding is a huge skill that many don't have and is a skill many should develop. asking someone a simple question like ""is this good to go?"" can truly impact someone's mindset of how to deal with problems, and can give them strong advice of how to handle the problem they currently have. multiple pieces of advise would make an even bigger impact on a person and give them more understanding of what others think. because of this they will be more prepared, and have a different mentality for future problems. from my personal experience, i can relate to having others critic and check my work because i know the helpfulness and understanding i get, can make a real impact on me.it has been proven that stress only causes harmful and emotional side effects to individuals. so, why not remove it? that is exactly why simple checks on your work, or something you may be unsure about can make a real impact. as stressful as everyday human lives can be, there's no harm done in taking a little out of your time to ask others about your situation and how to deal with it. being more sure on something can cause an individual to worry less and end up making better decisions. maybe you have a huge decision coming up like a proposal. you need to be absolutely sure and know it in your gut that this is the right decision to be made, and asking others can help you know that you are making the right decision or you are making the wrong decision. the more advice someone has, the more confident that someone can be, and can have less stress going through with that decision.if you live by the motto ""put others before yourself"" it is critical to understand that the decision you make could negatively affect others, as well as yourself. an example of this is smoking marijuana. by doing this, you could be causing others to be doing it as well, just because you are doing it. you could be at a legal age, but marijuana is still bad for you as well as others. asking your friends if they are okay with it and if it is a good decision, can cause you to realize that in the long run, it is a bad and not a thought-out decision. like said before, other people's lives are also important and seeking help before a decision, to make sure that it is good and well-thought out, can make a true impact in others. also, as modern day society is getting bigger and bigger, and people are becoming more reliant on safety, it is extremely important to ensure and provide safety for each individual, and asking for other's advice can ensure you that your decision is safe and responsible.all people strive to do what's right, whether it be doing right toward others, or to yourself.doing right toward others and yourself doesn't just mean getting good grades or achieving an award, but it means doing the right thing. asking others for advice can ensure that you are doing right toward others and yourself. when doing this, you can seek out understanding of the problem you are facing, which can be an important skill for people to have. throughout asking others for advice, you can relieve stress by knowing what you did was right, and you can be assured that what you are doing is safe and responsible, which won't have side effects that could harm or hurt others. a simple skill, asking others for help or advice, can truly make in impact in others and yourself.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

E740029E13D1,"the united states has ways of being civilaized, and thats by electing leaders. those leaders that take role of the responsiblitiy are president. presidents need candidates to vote for them. the only way the president will get elected is by the electoral college or by popular vote. although both ways are effective, only one way is the best. the u.s should stick with the electoral college because its a game changer and trust worthy.to start off the electoral college is a game changer for election day. in the article "" in defenese of the electoral college"" the author states a good claim. richard states "" the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"". from this quote richard points out the even when a candidate has a good amount of  popular vote it all comes down to the electoral college. the reason is the electoral college is part of the candidate's team, whether its democrat or republican. in the article from richard he gave an example, "" obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney"". in this peice of information richard clearly states on how the electoral college is stronger then the popular votes. now in the article ""the indfensible electoral college"" which was written by bradford has a different claim. bradford states "" because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"". from this bradford wants to express that the electoral college is not fair to voters, and that it has cheesy methods. but even thought bradfort disagrees with the method, bradfort still stated the obvious. in the article plumer states "" taken shortly after al gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency"". although plumer disagree with the electoral college, bradford still notices on how the electoral college makes a huge difference. basically the electoral college is just a big game chnager on election day.futhermore the electoral college is just a trust worthy method to use. also it was like the first method to be used. in the first source ""what is the electoral college"", the author gives some great information. the office states "" the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resposibilities are"". in this statement the office is stating on how whichever party a person might be in, the electoral college will come through. the reason is because each state has an electoral college and those states are in differnet parties. if the state that a person might live in is democrat then the electoral college will go for that party, and same thing for the republican party. from the other side of bradford again wants a comeback. in his article bradford states ""in the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refuesd to vote for their party's candidate"". now no one would know if this is true but the electors might have their reasons. but richard a. posner comes back and states ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. in this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please. plus this makes it fair because candidates wont be getting votes all over the places. also the electoral college will be trust wirthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a vaild decision. so the electoral college just gives people want they want from trust.all in all the electoral college is just the better method of voting. the electoral college will give what the people want. also the electoral college  represents the states votes. the reason is because electoral colleges are game changers and a trust worthy method. certainly it wll be easier to choose a president and break ties.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0

D6AAE9DC566D,"driving with and without the use of a cell phone:nowadays when you are walking or even driving you see a lot of people with a smartphone, that's because 61.62% of our population has one. there are a lot of reasons why people are on their cellphones while driving. as well there are pros and cons of driving while texting. throughout many years the stats of accidents while on their phone has also increased.each year there are approximately 1.6 million car accidents throughout the united states. many of those are accidents due to texting and driving, almost 400,000 injuries a year. this means 1 out of 4 car accidents are due to distractions while texting and driving. there is an average of 3287 deaths a day, just by usage of cellphones while driving. stats show that the average age of accidents occur during young ages 17-30 years of age. in a survey, people were asked how many people text and drive and their answer was pretty shocking reporting more than 80% of the people has or done while driving.as to all the things there are pros and cons, but in this topic, there are cons and thoughts what people think are pros. nowadays technology is an everyday usage, us being away or not checking our phones consistently makes us feel the need to be plugged in. the majority of the scenes where people do this act end up in a car crash. hurting yourself or even getting killed is not the only danger you take, you also put other peoples life in danger. in some cases you could hit someone hurt them really badly, or even kill them. remembering what you did to the other person would not be your only punishment, you could go to jail and spend a long time in their just for the distraction of a couple seconds. some of the reasons why people think its a good thing is because they feel the need to be communicated with the world just in case something bad happens or basically if something bad happens on their way and feels the need to communicate it with someone or has an emergency. there are also many more reasons why people are on their phone.every person has a different excuse or reason why they are texting and driving but in overall there are some that are the most common of them all. you would imagine that being on a phone call would be top 3 or 5, but it's not that commun seeing people on a phone call. one of the main reasons it's obviously texting. another big reason is facebook, snapchat, any social media. a big reason is the camera, women just be taking pictures or videos of themselves, while on the other side guys have the trend to speed, or drive recklessly and record it to show it off. you also have people who find it entertaining to shop online or be reading the news as well as checking the weather. when people are really bored while driving or get stuck in traffic for a long period of time they are also watching videos or even movies.in conclusion, texting and driving is really not a great idea, while it comes to texting or being on a phone call. that important text you need to answer or send can wait a couple minutes while you get to somewhere safe. risking your life and others just to get that good quality picture is not worth it. people around you that care about you, will truly understand that you couldn't answer in that exact moment.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

C5382404A84B,"dear teacher_name,i think that u must have at least a b average to play a sport or activity is a bad rule because if someone is in a more challenging class then it is harder for them to get a higher grad. also maybe people need exercise and cant get it at home because they cant. or they cant do any sport or activity because they cant afford it these are some tough times. now just listen to me for a little bit as i back up those reasons.say if someone is in a level 1 class and are struggling in that class because level 1 classes are more difficult than level 2 classes. what if this person really wanted to try out but could not play because there grade is a c plus and need a b average to play on the sport team that they wanted to play on. and what if another kid had straight a' s but could not play on a team because they had one c then they couldn't play on that team.teacher_name what if there was a walking club at school and someone wanted to join the club because they needed to exercise. and that person really didn't want to get mad fun of anymore because they would get made fun of because they were big and lazy and they only had one bad grade and they couldn't do that just because they have one bad grade. so for my second reason that you have to have at least a b average.and lastly for my last reason say someone wasn't the richest person in town and could afford for their child to play on a recreational team so they wanted to play on a school team. but had one or two horrible grades and couldn't play who knows he could be really good. and finally that was my last reason for a child to play on a sports team or activity but must maintain a b average .again i think that it is a terrible rule for a child to play on a team or activity and must maintain a b average.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

2E4427B65439,"nasa. the united states form of a dominating space academy. the viking 1, was in fact nasa's spacecraft that was launched in 2001. the spacecraft was set course for the small, red planet that is simillar to earth. the planet is called mars. viking 1's ""sister"" viking 2 was supposed to be landing on mars, and that's why viking 1 was sent up in space to begin with. while viking 1 was snapping photos, its camera picked up a weird face-like structure on the surface of mars. some believe its a mysterious face that ""so called aliens"" built. i believe that their reasoning is just a bunch of garbage. what i think that is, is just a simple and natural landform made by the underground volcanoes, sandy surface, and rocks that landed there.one reason i believe that this is a natural landform is from looking at the photos. the ""face"" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. the landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. if you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but if you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. in addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.that part of the theory makes more sense if you take into consideration the angle the camera could have been taken at. notice photo two? its seems to be taken at an angle where there looks like there is a small mountain range looming over the rest of the area. this is key evidence explaining how this is just a natural landmark on mars.if you still do not believe me, then this next part will. if you think about it, why would nasa keep an amazing discover like this a secret? the answer is that they would not. if nasa went worldwide with their ""face"" they would make more money than millionaires or even other space academies. it does not make sense that the academy would keep an alien encounter hidden.in conclusion, nasa is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their ""face"", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not. therefore; this ""so called face"" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5

5D48FA3291DE,"it is better to ask more people for advice than to just ask one person, because someone can hear more points of view, it leads to more discussion, and the person with a problem can think about a decision or problem more. when asking for advice, it is usually to solve a problem. if someone only gets one perspective on a problem and then makes a decision, it is a quick decision to what could be a more important problem. when multiple people are asked for advice, they will have different ways on how they see a particular problem. this is good because it helps look at a situation in more than one way, and make a decision that makes the most sense. when multiple people are asked, there is more of a discussion about a problem, which can help think of more ideas.one of the reasons asking more people for advice is the best way to go, is that someone can hear all of the different ways people look at a situation. this is good for the person who is asking advice, because the person can look at the problem in all different ways, and see which solution best fits their personal needs and goals. this is better because what makes sense to one person, might not make sense to another person. as they say, nobody knows someone better than them self, which applies to someones problems. hearing different points of views will also allow someone to see which point of view is the most popular opinion, and they can make their decision based off of what most people agree on.another reason why asking multiple people for advice is better than asking only one person, is that it leads to more discussion. when there is a situation that needs a solution, the best way to find a solution is through discussion. when only one person is asked for advice, there will only be one discussion, and there will be only one point of view. when multiple people are asked, the person asking for advice will have a lot more discussion about the problem they're facing. when asking multiple people for advice, the person asking could also bring up previously heard points of view and see what everyone else thinks of that opinion. once the person asking hears many opinions, and opinions on others' opinions, the discussion created will help them think more about the problem, and ultimately find the right decision.the final reason why someone should ask multiple people for advice, is because it causes somebody to think about a situation for longer. if only one person is asked for advice, then there will be only one time where it is discussed. when multiple people are asked for advice, it will take up a longer amount of time, and will most likely be at different times and days. this is good because people can change their minds very quickly, and what someone thinks of their situation one day, might not be what they think of it the next day. when more people are asked for advice, all of the time it takes to ask them can be used to deliberate and decide which decision may be the best. when asking one person for advice, someone may only think of a solution to a problem over the course of one day. when asking multiple people, it could require someone to think of a solution for multiple days. this will make sure they think of all possible decisions and outcomes, so they don't make a spontaneous decision.when asking for advice, it is better to ask multiple people than to just ask one person. this is because asking more than one person leads to hearing more points of view, having more discussion about a problem, and thinking about a problem for longer. asking one person for advice will limit a decision and it may lead to someone making a bad decision. asking multiple people for advice can lead somebody to become more open minded about a problem, or even life in general. for these many reasons, asking multiple people for advice is the best way to find a solution to a problem or situation.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
D81428AC9545,"dear principal,i think that students shouldn't be required to do community service because there family might not have time or maybe there parents wont let them. i think it would be nice for some children to help out but they shouldn't have to. the children should not be responsible to take on actions on doing other peoples stuff because it might have not been them who either littered or did something that the person that did this action should be responsible for it. children should only be required to do community service if they have served time in jail and is required by the law or they are doing it for a good cause like when they have to do it at there school so they are ready for college and have to learn what their life is going to be about. so that's some of the reasons why i think that kids shouldn't have to take on doing community service. taking time to do community kind of takes away being able to be a kid because you don't really get to hang out with friends and family , you don't get to have your own time and you might not have time to do your homework and that might cause you to have failing grades which even takes away more of your privilege's to hang out with friends or have your own time so i think that being required to do community service shouldn't be allowed unless you have done something so that you have to do community service. all though community service looks good on your college application so children should try to participate with community service but shouldn't be required at least you should wait until the kids are a senior in h.s. to start require community service.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

487739AC4B1E,"in 2002, a study showed that only 23% of americans asked more than one person when seeking advice. however, asking more than one person for advice may get you different answers because people have gone through different experiences. they most likely had different outcomes, some good and others bad. asking multiple people for their opinions can improve your knowledge because people have gone through different experiences, the elderly has lived through history, and even if people aren't there your peers post blogs and websites online.to begin with, everyone lives their own life and makes their own decisions; therefore, they go through different journeys and down different paths. when i was little, my mother told me a story her parents told her when she was my age. it started out with my grandma, generic_name, being about twelve years old and not knowing what to do. she needed advice. my grandmother decided her best option was to ask multiple people and see what they had to say. initially, she decided she would talk to her mom, my great grandmother, and she told her a story about what she did and how it went well when she went through the same experience. next she decided she would talk to her dad, he told her the same story that her mom told her but from his point of view since he never had to deal with it. her next choice was to talk to her best friend, generic_name, but she had an awful time with this when it happened to her, yet generic_name still gave her advice. generic_name was thankful she had asked three people because she received three different outcomes.additionally, an author once said, ""treat your elders with respect as they are older and wiser."" the elderly has gone through going to school but while that happened and they were growing up they also lived through wars, poverty, some may have kids or even grandkids, and over the past about twenty or so years new ages/generations, and the upbringing of technology. the author mentioned ""wiser"", they have lived through so much and they were always learning something new. therefore, they know a lot and can be another option for giving advice.lastly, whether the decision you have to make is life changing or a small choice there is always someone or something that can help. about two years ago my best friend, generic_name, called me and told me to come over as soon as i could. not knowing what any of this was about, i rushed over there and she said she needed to talk. i listened while she told me this sad story about generic_name, her sixteen year old cousin, who was now pregnant. she continued to talk and asked me what i thought. i was speechless knowing that her cousin was thinking about getting an abortion. generic_name said that generic_name's parents and grandparents passed away in a car accident two months ago and generic_name was angry at the world so she went to a college party, had too much to drink, and met a guy. a month later, she found out she was pregnant and did not have anyone to talk to. she spent the next month looking up ""how to take care of a baby"", ""abortion"", ""teen pregnancy"", and a lot of other things before she had talked to generic_name and asked for advice. generic_name had gotten some advice from blogs and websites online but she also wanted to talk to generic_name before she made a decision, but generic_name didn't know what to do, so she called me. the next week, we went to lunch with generic_name and had a long discussion. we didn't force her into or out of anything; although, we did give her our opinions. as we were leaving, generic_name mentioned that she was thankful that she looked up blogs and websites online and that she was able to talk to us. no matter how big or small the choice, someone is always there.in conclusion, when you ask more than one person for advice it can better your understanding because people have had different outcomes with similar experiences, your elders are wiser and can be another option for giving advice, and if you do not have people to support you and give you advice, people in your community and around the world post websites and blogs online. your peers, community, family, and friends are all there to support you and help give advice. no matter how big or small the decision is, someone is always there to help. before making a life changing choice or decision ask multiple people for advice.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
6E3219126915,"having children partake in extra curricular activities can help your children, become more sociable, and become more involved in their schools. after school programs are also very good at helping new students become more integrated into the school system. by partaking in extracurricular activities you can meet new people and gain great experiences. by having your children participate in extracurricular activities like, sports teams, or student run organizations, the experiences you could gain could potentially be very rewarding for your later years.children all over the world participate in extracurricular group activities. for example young children in switzerland have little after school groups called ""horts"" where they eat together, clean together, finish homework together, and play together. those ""horts"" can form life-long friendships and form even closer bonds to their classmates. i think by implementing those same practices we can help future generations become even more tight knit and overall become much closer. so instead of eating alone at lunch and being sad, your child would have a much happier lunch with good friends and a much tighter knit school community. so by partaking in extracurricular activities, your child can form stronger bonds, stronger friendships, and even new friends as well.secondly, extracurricular activities can help children relax, and in some circumstances, they could potentially help children improve their grades. for instance one of the best stress relieving thing you can do is to exercise, but most people don't like to exercise because they don't think its fun. but if you exercise with friends, then it can be really fun, because generally everything you do with friends is more fun than doing anything alone. so by joining a sports team you get to relieve your stress, by exercising and you get to have fun with some friends. also if you happen to be super talented when it comes to your sport you could even get offers to play college and you could potentially even receive scholarships. but if you want to receive good scholarships you must also be a good student, now generally most schools offer tutoring or homework clubs which can be very helpful if you want to improve your grades. so in general after curricular activities can help improve your grades and can help you feel more relaxed. now don't you want to be happy in school and don't you want good grades?now some people may ask, ""what if my child doesn't like sports?"" you can tell them that not all after school activities are sports related, and so instead of making your kids play sports try letting them pick what they want to do. there are so many good clubs and organizations to join in school so why not take advantage of it? for example you could join the yearbook committee or join student council, there are so many options we could keep going forever. now what if your child does not like any of the extracurricular activities? schools are great places to try new things, just because your child has never done something before does not mean they won't necessarily like it. so before you jump the gun and say you child does not like something maybe let them explore their options first.in conclusion, by having your children participate in extra curricular activities, the experiences that were gained, would be so rewarding in the end for growing children. in my opinion extracurricular activities are great places for children to discover who they are, what they like, what they want to be when they grow up and so much more. i believe that all students should participate in extracurricular activities because they can help children like me discover who they are.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

326DEFF8D486,"dear principlemost of the teenagers use there phones half of there life, reconsidering the school's cell phone policy is a great idea, for many reason and some of the reasons are these. even though you say not to bring cell phones to school students still do it , some of the students need to bring there phones to school to communicate with there parents telling them that they're at school. other students need there phones incase of an emergency, and there parents need to contact there kids or the parents need to be contacted, the school can use there phones. it is a great idea letting the students use there phones during lunch or free periods that gives the students a feeling of trust from the school.not allowing students to use there phones at all is not really going to help. the students will find a way to bring there phones to school and use them while the teachers are not looking. most of the students are already doing it, why you think putting a new policy is going to help the school it really is not, but by letting the students bring there phones in school and giving them time to use them is going to let the students know that the school trusts them, that the school doesn't think of them as children but as young and responsible adults.to change the policy you have to look at the problem is booth ways in the mind of a teacher and in the mind of a student. some of the teachers may think by bringing a phone to school is a sign of not having respect but it really isn't students don't mean to be rude. sometimes there parents even ask them to bring there phones, other times the students want to bring there phones. the students in the other side feel as if the school doesn't trust them by not letting them bring there phones to school, they feel like children. all of this can be resolved if you let the students bring there phones to school and have them off and not use them, and letting them use them in there free time.sincerelyyour student",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
F3C003AF7423,"""why does everyone think i shouldn't go to the movie with generic_name?"" confusingly asks generic_name. the whole group just sighs and gives generic_name a quick glance with a voice backing it all up saying, ""she just isn't right for you that's why."" generic_name looks to the ground with defeat on the outside but rage filled on the inside which causes him to try giving a quick defending response. all that came out of his mouth was,""well what if you're wrong,"" which caused the whole group to walk away with quiet whispers and a few laughs. seeking advice from more than one person is a better choice because it gives you different points of view, more options to choose from, and keeps you closer to the people around you.first off, seeking opinions from others can be a better choice than only getting an opinion from one person because, it gives you multiple points of view. a great example of this is when my friend generic_name got in a fight once. he got sent to the office and was claiming he didn't start it and it was self defense, so they called in a few people who saw what had happened and found out generic_name was telling the truth. this is important because if you only ask one person they can use their bias opinion to make a person or situation seem better or worse than it actually was. another example is in football when there is a call being made all the refs huddle up to talk about their opinions on what happened during the play. this highlights the fact that when there are multiple opinions the out come is usually better and more logical.secondly, another good thing about seeking others opinions it can give you more options to choose from. for instance, this happens a lot in the sports world on final plays of the game. what happens is there is not much time left on the clock so they all try to figure out the best play possible to win and try to execute it. this is only useful when there is multiple opinions and plays coming in because with out different options than the one option used might not have been the best one or the most successful. to illustrate, another time having multiple opinions is helpful is when you have a girlfriend. i had the similar thing happen to me when i was dating someone because i didn't have any ideas for a date, so when i asked my friends i had much better and more ideas. all the ideas were helpful and useful and made my date worth while.lastly, seeking advice from multiple people is better because it keeps you closer to the people around you. an example of this is when i asked my friends for their opinion on the sport of basketball it not only made me contact them and talk to them but now they know that i am working on a report for school. this helps all of us out because know they know i'm working on my report which means i can't hang out right now and i reminded them about it and made them do it. in addition, this happens a lot when my mom asks one of our neighbors for their opinion on a certain product, but it ends up turning into them catching up and talking for the first time in a while. this helps my mom and our neighbors to stay in touch and get better opinions on products or services.""hey guys, what do you think i should do for me and generic_name's anniversary?"" asks generic_name. they all think for a quick second then spit out ideas at generic_name like a waterfall. ""necklace, gift, chocolate, and flowers."" quickly states the group. while generic_name is still processing the information, he says, ""i think i'll just go with the necklace and flowers, but thanks for the ideas."" all in all, seeking out multiple opinions for advice is better than only having one opinion.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

6776B92E4513,"during summer break, many students are busy on vacation or are preoccupied with other activities. because of this, students are not reinforcing what they have previously learned or preparing for the upcoming school year. summer projects are an efficient way to get students familiar with and exposed to concepts they will learn in school and bolster their knowledge. however, the decision of making summer projects either teacher-designed or student-designed creates a debate of the effectiveness of both types of projects. summer projects should be teacher-designed as teachers are more knowledgeable with the curriculum which will allow them to prepare an assignment that is more effective for the student, teacher-assigned projects will provide a guide for what the students will or should learn, and students will most likely feel more prepared for school with an assignment created by the teacher.since teachers know more about the subject they teach more than the students, having teachers create their own assignment for their students will be more effective. they know what the students need to learn based on the curriculum, so it is ideal for them to decide what they should study over the break. students will get more out of the assignment if the teacher prepares an assignment that relates directly to what they will learn in class when school begins. it will also strengthen their knowledge and possibly reinforce what they had learned before.teacher-designed projects will be a guide for students during their summer break to study useful information for their classes. teachers can design projects that is relevant to the curriculum of the class and plan out what is necessary and useful to know versus what is not. in addition, teachers usually expose basic ideas and important concepts that will help students to make connections to what they learned through the summer assignment. these teacher-designed also provides some insight for the student on what to expect in the courses that they take.having teachers make their own summer projects will expose the material that students need to know when they go back to school. it will help students to feel more comfortable coming to class and ready to begin learning. through these projects, students have studied and have a better understanding of the curriculum of the class as the teacher directed the students on content they need to know. these projects also help students to gradually feel familiar with concepts they learn in the beginning of the school year rather than jumping straight ahead to learning something new.not only do teacher-designed projects enforce learning and help students to get more comfortable with the content of the class, but they also prepare students before the upcoming school year begins. it is ideal for teachers to design such projects as they know most about the curriculum of the class, and it allows them to prepare a useful tool for students to study to get familiar with concepts and important ideas of the class. these projects are a small exposure of what students are expected or need to know and will help them to be more successful when they begin learning in their classes.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

A135E9280900,"dear teacher_name,there has been a lot of controversy on weather to require all children of school_name to perform community service and although this would be good in some ways this would be worse for many reasons, because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities, makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home.my first reason is that forcing children to work on community service is that it takes time away from extra curricular activities. it's a common known fact that america has problems with obesity. making kids do community service would definitely take time off of children's clock that they could be doing active activities like working out or playing a sport. this would increase obesity rates in america even more, causing the life span of children in this country to shrink.my second point is that forcing children to do community service makes it seem more like work, rather than if you didn't it would seem like something you do for fun, like a hobby. community service is something that should be done because kids want to help other kids, the environment or those who need help. this wouldn't only make the amount of work done plummet, but also the quality of the work. if a kid is performing community service and is really enjoying himself, he is much more likely going to get a lot done and it is going to be very good quality work.my third, and final point is that forcing children to perform community service is taking time away from children's school work or studying at home. there is no doubt that children in this very room that i'm writing this paper in are struggling to pass the 8th grade. forcing them to do community service would only increase the number of failing students at school_name. this would not only be problematic for the children that are failing, but would also hurt this schools' reputation of having good academic program.in conclusion forcing children to perform community service would be problematic for three reasons, because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities, makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home.sincerely, student_name, student of school_name.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

1F58CB4D5847,"asking for opinions and advice from multiple people, helps one gain perspective. by asking of another's opinion, one can base their opinion off what they have heard, or know. another reason why seeking a range of people's advice is a better choice than just hearing one opinion is, one can determine the best method for them self, or to check if something is valid.perspective allows one to hear stronger, usually more opinionated parts of the problem. for example, if a student were to talk to a math teacher versus an civics teacher about which subject is most important for middle school, the math teacher would likely say math is the most important subject, while the civics teacher would say civics is most useful subject. if we looked from either one of the teachers perspective, we would easily identify on of the main causes of the biased.the math teacher chose math as the most important middle school subject immediately, this is because they have spent more time studying and have learned more than what is necessary to graduate college, and have grown to love math. the civics teacher would do the same for civics because they have learned more than most others in civics and have grown more attached to the subject.by listening to both teachers opinions, the student is a to better determine which subject they believe is more important in middle school.when hearing advice from another, one can determine the best suited method for them self, by checking the validity of what a person said. an example would be, if a patient is unsure if they need braces, and as a result they talk to multiple dentists. the patient can use all the information to determine which dentist is best for them by putting what all the dentists said together.if dr. one, says the patient needs braces for 6 months, but dr. two says the patient needs braces for a year and a half, the patient is likely to see a third dentist. dr. three says something completely different, that she needs no braces, with no evidence, so the patient knows the orthodontist is untrustworthy. however, dr. four confirms the patient will need braces for a year in a half so the patient knows both dr. two and dr. four are their best options because they agree.by asking so many professionals whether the patient needs braces or not, the patient can ensure they get the best care for their teeth.the method of asking many people for their advice helps people look at perspective and detect biased. by doing this, one can find the most helpful, accurate advice or answer possible. this helps one gain their own perspective and opinions based on what they have learned from others.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

BA2C7291BBFA,"to the principalthe reason for this paper is that i would like to, participate in anything that is required to do. i want to help in the communities work. i want to help others and do something important. i want to have a good for my own good and others. i think that is important to help because we never know if we will need help later on. and also i think that is important to do good things for the community sense we live and are the community.my idea is to help reading to little kids or even clean the school. i would like to help on something productive and on something that benefits all. the other thing that i personally think that is a good idea is to give food and water to people that do not have it. we can all donate food and gallons of water and then cook it and go to places where they really need the food and give it to them. i think that when we give we get the double of that.i know that what we do is going to be for the best of all. we can even go and buy cloth and give it to poor children that need it. i know that there is maybe more than 10 kids this really need cloth and food, i know because two years ago i went on vacation to mexico and i was being really selfish. my dad took me to an orphanage and i got to see how the poor kids lived in that horrible place and i imagine how it wold be if i lived there.from that i experienced that you should not care only about your self but care and about others too. that is the reason that i am willing to help because i know how people need help and in many ways that is why i want to help. i know it may be a hard job but it is worth all the work. i know that it feels good",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
63AFEF7824B1,"when people look to others for advice, it is because they cannot think of what to do themselves or they don't trust themselves enough to make good decisions on their own. some people find it good to have an outsider's perspective, so they can see the situation from a different viewpoint. they also like to ask others what they would do in that situation, because everyone handles things differently. occasionally people have gone through a similar situation, which often makes them knowledgeable on what to do. there are many ways to handle situations, but when in need of help you should confide in others for the best advice on how to make a better decision.if you are in an argument with someone or you just need some advice, asking others is good for you to do because they can give you a new perspective. in an argument people tend to be very blindsided and naive, because they always think they are in the right. however there are always two sides to every story, and other people can help you see both. many times you don't understand what someone else might be going through and it is always good for someone to humble you every now and then to make you understand others. whenever something is going wrong, it's necessary to understand it ask someone else what they think by viewing all sides or the problem.another thing to ask when you need advice is what would they do in that situation. often people think a completely different way then you, and would handle it in other ways then you. most people are either passive aggressive or just aggressive and this can change the way they do things. with my problems i tend to be more passive aggressive, because i don't like arguments or confrontation, but most of my friends are the opposite. in times where i would normally not do anything until it becomes a big mess, my friends would already haven confronted the situation a long time ago. that was some reasons why asking others what they would do can help you come up with what you should decide.occasionally people have already gone through the exact same thing that is happening to you. this can make them wise, because they can use their past experiences to tell you what to do and what not to do. for example, when you need that push to do something you're scared of they can help you with that. when they tell you it went well for them, it helps you to follow in their footsteps. if there was a problem in their past experience they can warn you not to do that. one example might be that a girl dated this horrible guy who cheated on her, and she sees him with another girl so she talks to the the girl and warns the girl about what happened to her. asking a person about their past experiences is one of the best ways to figure out what is right for you to decide.the saying that other people show the best in you can be used when talking about giving advice, because people can show you new ways to see something or tell you something that you didnt know. friends can show you the situation you are in from all different angles and not just the one you are stuck in. they can also tell you what they would do in your shoes, or how they would handle your position. past experiences can change a persons perspective of their life so they don't make the same mistake twice, but they can also help others to not make the mistake at all. in conclusion, there are many ways others can help you for advice like sharing their past, saying what they would do, and showing you all perspectives. everything talked about in this essay can help you come to your conclusion on what is best for you.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
9EABE5CEBE94,"generic_name sighed while he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, and was pretty bummed that he realized he didn't join any clubs or sports during his time at school. even though his friends recommended that he should, he didn't really want to do it. all of his friends that joined activities made cool, new friends in the clubs they were in, and became more active when they participated in sports. he was upset that he didn't do any of those things in middle school, but decided that he would give it a chance when he went to high school. when he got home, generic_name thought about the kinds of clubs he wanted to join, and different sports he wanted to participate in, and was looking forward to it.students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity during school because it can help you make new friends, help you become more fit/ stay active depending on the activity, and can improve your skills on specific things. if you join any sports or clubs, you are definitely going to meet new people to make your friends, which is a great thing because it gives you people to talk to and get along with so you won't be by yourself in any activities you would do after school. however, some people don't like joining clubs because they could be antisocial or can be nervous and have trouble meeting new people, but it's okay, it takes time to get used to people you dont know, so joining clubs and making new friends can help you be more social and find it easier to get along with others. joining sports/ physical clubs can help you stay in shape and stay healthy because most sports will most likely have you break a sweat, and a lot of sports include running and jumping, and require some strength. volleyball, wrestling, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, etc, keep you active and healthy because your exercising by doing sports which is good for your body, but you have to keep in mind not to overwork yourself because it can become tiring and maybe a little dangerous if you work for too long without taking any breaks. sports can definitely become rough and you can really get hurt if your not careful, so it's important to get enough sleep, eat right, and stay hydrated before playing so you don't risk getting injured.being in most clubs can help to improve skills on different things such as art, cooking or baking, acting, writing, sewing, and things like that. some things that are provided in different clubs can really come in handy at some point in your future. learning new things or improving your skills can impress your friends and family, and can sometimes earn you money. for example, if you improve in art or sewing, you would be able to sell it for a bit of money depending on how skilled you are, maybe $20-$30, or if you're good at cooking/ baking, you could sell it at a bake sale or maybe just give it to your friends or family to enjoy as a treat. learning new things and improving skills can be fun, but sometimes it can take time and effort to put into learning new things and improving, so you have to be willing to take time into that and do your best because it's worth it in the end.generic_name smiled as he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, as he sat down in his seat with the friends he made during the year through after school activities, they remembered and talked about all the cool sports and clubs they did during their time throughout middle school. they remembered the clubs they joined such as facs club and art club, and how their skills on baking and drawing improved, they also talked about the sports like soccer and basketball they all participated in together, and generic_name can definitely say that he's gotten healthier since he joined. when he got home, he thought about trying out for the basketball team again during high school and was really looking forward to it.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

DB9CAE4A0E72,"in today's society, things are growing and changing at a rapid rate. there are new technological advances and new ideas and innovations that come into this world everyday. one particular subject that comes in mind is the idea of online courses. these courses are mainly for people who do not have easier access or any type of transportation to school which can lead to be very useful. people love this idea and innovation of school and think students could genuinely benefit from this. undoubtedly, there are a lot of flaws to this, the one major problem that stands out the most is it could cause students to take advantage of these online courses and cheat by using another browser to look up their answer's and could lead to long-term consequences. through these observations, students would not be able to benefit from online courses because students are more likely to cheat, they can gain an in-person experience with teachers, and students can build positive relationships at school.although taking classes from home can be easier to access, students should have more of a in-person experience with teachers to show that they care and help students better understand the questions they have. for instance, i have gone to school from a laptop and in person and having the teachers there in person is a very different experience to have than from learning off of a laptop. because not only does it show that the teachers care, but it makes the students feel like they are really engaged in the activity and makes it more fun to learn. teachers set the rule for students and sometimes show them the difference between right and wrong. they also sometimes have students engage in fun activities as for another way to learn. instead of being taught through a screen, people that have teachers in person help students understand what they are trying to learn and can engage in one-on-one conversations in person.even though students can learn from home and not go out anywhere, students need to build positive relationships with others. friends are an ideal part of everyone's lives and online course do not provide that, but schools do. my friend, who i just recently met and has been home schooled his whole life until his senior year, found it hard to have friends because he did not know anybody. he is a shy person and does not like interacting with any out-going activities because he did not know how to engage with other people. because of this, people who go to public schools at a young age are more likely to make friends there and have even more friends the more they grow up and as they enter high school. all in all, online courses do not provide people like friends that are a key part of our lives and help us build our character and self-esteem about each other.a major problem about online courses is that students are more likely to cheat on them and use different web browsers to get the answers they need. unlike online courses, teachers can observe students during their classwork and exam to see if they are cheating or not. for example, a teacher can watch you in person and closely, but the teacher through the screen can only see what you show and not your full body as in person. this shows that cheating could be a major key flaw to online courses and shows that it does not very well help a student learn or understand in any way possible. in fact, it does the opposite of that. undoubtedly, online courses are subject to very likely cheating and does not prepare students for any type of further learning after high school.in conclusion, online course do not benefit students because gaining an in-person experience with teachers can help a student learn better from their mistakes on certain types of questions. they also do not benefit students by having more of a likely chance to cheat during exams online. because of this, this does not prepare students for further growth of knowledge if they want to continue to do school after high school. the final reason students do not benefit from online courses is that students need friends in person because that is what makes them have a good childhood and become a better person based of off their opinions. to conclude, online courses are not a way to help students at all during this day and age. it has too many flaws that can not be fixed unfortunately. a lot of things are growing in this society, but this should not grow any further.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

4BB688100D15,"imagine you receiving advice from someone, but you go ask other people because you're not sure if it's considerable. what i would do in this situation is to not ask one person for advice, i would go to other people and listen to their opinions. just by listening to different people's perspective you gain more information to help you find a reliable solution. for me, that is the correct choice because it makes more sense to absorb others advice to find a better choice. i believe everyone has the opportunity to seek others opinions to make a better choice by involving others, being curious, and relying on your peers.by involving others, you can learn a lot of new things just by including multiple opinions. to involve other people you can start off by asking for their point of view, so they can end up changing your mind about your situation for something better. you could also involve others by using their opinion, and ask different people about that person's perspective, and see which one would lead you to make a final choice. finally, another way to involve others to seek a better choice is by expressing your own opinion, and talking to another person to observe your opinion. i find these ways better to trust, so you don't have to involve only one person.being curious helps you find a better belief about a situation you are not sure of. to be curious you could go up to people for advice, and possibly give them options to see which one has a better meaning. on the other hand, you could be curious by listening to what is important or not, and by asking for examples if you don't quite understand. asking multiple questions of the person's advice and finding the pro's and con's of the situation is another way of being curious. being curious is the key to lead you to the right path to find a better choice.relying on your peers can help you find a better understanding of their advice. an example of relying on others is to build trust with a variety of people to make sure you know that person will give you a positive result. another way to rely on your peers is to make sure you know them well enough to ask them for advice, and so that you don't go the opposite way of making a consistent choice. however, relying on your peers will make you feel more confident about their opinions, and consider making the right choice. relying on others will help you follow success by considering others perspectives.overall, i think listening to other people's point of view is the key to help you make a better choice. using your peers and your surroundings will get you to the right path. to make better choices, and using the opportunity to seek opinions is to involve others, be curious, and rely on your peers to find your solution. have you ever thought about talking to other people to find reliable advises? do you think this will help in the future as well?",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
7480BDC7C131,i think that it isn't right to change the school policy because some students cant pull there grade up to a b or higher. i think that it should stay the way it is because a c is still a passing grade and its hard to focus on 2 things at once because there is always homework that you have to do or a test that you have to study for and you have to practice for a game that's coming up or you have to go to practice so that means you wont have that much time to finish your homework or study for the next test that's coming up and you cant finish your notebook for the notebook check that's coming up so its hard to focus on 2 things at once. so if you just keep it the way it is then it will be less stressful for the students and they will have less things to worry about. i think that it will be reasonable if you don't let students play sports if they have a f or a d because that isn't a passing grade so they wont have 2 things to worry about at once because they will only be focusing on school only. this is my opinion and i hope other students have the same opinion because it will be easier for most kids in this school thanks for reading this i hope you really think about it.,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

273D52E9DC95,"seeking multiple opinions helps make better choicesmany people seek several opinions for advice because it helps them piece together the ideas they get and create a better way of going about something. it lets them see multiple ways of doing something while also allowing them to separate the good advice from the bad advice. this is why people get advice from the people they trust. the person seeking advice knows that they will put thought into the advice they give them.everyone thinks differently and has their own perspective on everything. this is why many people have very different ideas and opinions. listening to another person's opinions can open your mind to the different ways of doing something. it can also help some people to grow as a person and be able to take their own advice.in order to get the most well rounded advice a person must ask a variety of different people. often times someone will only ask one person for advice, making their point of view limited. they are only getting one opinion, and aren't able to see how other people interpret what they want to know.another reason why a person may ask several people for advice is because there are many people who give bad advice. unfortunately some people don't want to help and only want to focus on themselves. so they give a person poor advice in hopes that the person will stop asking. then there are some people who are ignorant to the topic.they don't know enough about the topic to give someone proper advice. usually these types of people don't have malevolent intentions, they just don't know the right things to say. asking many people helps to separate the good advice from the bad advice people give. it also can help to find the people in someone's life that care about their well being. which, in the future, will help them make better decisions on later things, because they will know who gives the best advice.lastly, hearing several opinions can narrow down what not to do. if many people say to not do something then the person knows that majority of people agree it will only do them harm. it is the same for the things a person should do. if many people have the same advice then they know that it's the right thing to do. indecisiveness is prevalent in many people. having several voices present should enforce the person to make a decision. someone can also put together all of the advice they get and find the common denominator of the advice. making the person self assured about following the advice people gave, because so many of their peers thought the same way. you can tweak all of the advice to create a better idea or a stronger piece of advice. usually your own advice is best for yourself, so adding other people's advice to your own can help you make a greater choice.in all, asking more people gets someone more advice. it makes a person feel sure of their decisions and more confident about the choice they will make. in the end when they go through with their choice they will get it done more precisely than if they had not gotten advice. however, there are times where finding the right advice is hard but, asking several people can help determine what the most positive decision is.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

2FA001A3D229,"when asking people for advice, usually asking a close friend or a trusted adult is what first comes to mind. in some cases, more than one person needs to be asked.when advice is needed asking more than one person can be better than just asking one. in the event that advice is needed, asking two or maybe even three people can be a lot more reassuring. new ideas are brought to the table meaning more options to choose from when the decision needs to be made. as an example, generic_name might not know what to do when the school bully tells him to meet him after school on the blacktop to fight. generic_name asks his friend what to do and his friend has the same idea as him. asking two or three people might give new or maybe even better ideas than the one that he thought of. so now generic_name is avoiding the fight, and is safe because his other friends told him to tell the principal.asking more than one person might also add to your idea. for an example, generic_name wants salad but doesn't know what to put on it. he puts the lettuce shredded cheese and ham on it but he knows he's missing something. he asks his friends to see what they say. one friend asks if he has put tomatoes on it, and another asks if he put croutons on it yet. so with these new ideas at hand, he can now add these items to his salad, and has a salad ready for lunch tomorrow.making better decisions is another outcome for asking multiple people for advice. as an example, generic_name is at the shoe store looking for some new shoes for school. he is trying to get the newest pairs of jordans' because he wanted to be the first at his school to have them, but they are way too expensive. on the other hand, he could get a much cheaper pair of air force ones but then he would look like everyone else. generic_name is really indecisive, so he calls his friend to see what he says. his friend tells him to buy the jordan but they are too expensive. generic_name then asks his dad, and his dad says the air force ones are much more affordable and look good too. generic_name not knowing what to do suddenly remembers that basketball season is coming up, and the only pair of basketball shoes are beaten up and dirty. generic_name then asks one of the employees that work there is they have any basketball shoes. the employee directs him to the basketball section and generic_name sees the basketball shoes hes been wanting, and at an affordable price.there are times when you need some advice, and a lot of it. asking more than one person is better in many different ways. some for making better decisions, and some just to hear the opinions of others and what they think is the best thing to do. someone once said, ""two heads are better than one"".",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5

0D359BCEE452,"by the author of this topic is really persauding by true facts where it makes u think. can we really live on venus the normal way or a new way? during all this time all the best and expert sciencetist are working together to test a method nd see if we can live on that planet without dying or not producing food or water or even shelter. while testing we figured out that venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to our sun. beyond high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. so that is why i think during the proccess on living venus or in the future testing methods if we could live pn venus or see if we can grow crops or bring like equiment to test samples on we can evole on this planet near us. even the thought of going to a new planet is a big turn of events because we dont know how its atmosphere works or gravity or air/oxygen or weather climate change or anything but we are learning about it really fast where we have to make a high expert group of people to risk their lives to see if we can produce our species or our tech,food,citys, or even animal life in conculsion to make sure that we sure we dont make the smallest mistake to screw up the plans for us to live or visit venus in future but in mean time we have people training to become the best of the best for this secret peoject if it happens. so that is all i gotta say and i hope it does happen to make history on the board for people to live on a new generation. so our main goal is all about striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. even nasa is working on other approaches to studying venus. for example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venuss surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
06936C8AA35D,"everyone has found themselves in that sticky situation where you just don't know what to do. there are so many problems running through your mind and so many ways to solve them. your head is jumbled up, and you can't think straight anymore. you start stressing out and sweating and you just have absolutely no idea what do to!in this scenario most people go to their friends and family for help. they ask as many people as they can to give them advice to help them make the best choice. seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by exposing them to many different ways to interpret and solve problems, helping them think about their choices thoroughly without getting stressed out or anxious, and opening their mind to all the possible choices and outcomes of the situation.to start with, the first reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is because it can expose them to many different ways to interpret and solve problems. studies show that when given the same situation, almost 80% of people choose different ways to solve them. this is beneficial because it shows that everyone has their own ways of solving problems, so when you ask people around you which choice they would make in a certain situation you will get many different ways. this can help you think through each suggestion and decide which one is right for you.the second reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is because it can help them think about their choices thoroughly without getting stressed out or anxious. there are many people that have a hard time making decisions on their own. they go back and forth between all the choices that they could possibly make, and all it does is make them anxious. i know this from personal experience because i'm a very indecisive person, and making big decisions stress me out a lot. but when i have the opinions of multiple people to help me, it makes the decision process so much easier. they all tell me their input and what they would do, and it calms me down and helps me think through it clearer.the final reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is because it can open their mind to all the possible choices and outcomes of a situation. sometimes when people have to make a decision, they think that there is only a couple options to choose from. they don't stretch their mind to think outside the box and think of other choices they can make. but when they ask multiple people of their intake on the situation, they will realize that there are so many more options to choose from. they might even start thinking harder and coming up with creative ideas on their own!in conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by exposing them to many different ways to interpret and solve problems, helping them think about their choices thoroughly without getting stressed out or anxious, and opening their mind to all the possible choices and outcomes of the situation. doing this can also help people make decisions easier, and can help many people think clearer when making decisions. as a result, they will always figure out which choice is best for them.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

D30490AE8641,"dear principle,i'm writing you this letter to inform you on what i think you should do. i know you are trying whether or not if all students should be required to do any community service. community service is good but not all the students would wan' t you to make it a requirement. so here is my argument on what you should do.i think that you need to think about the community service. some of the kids are already doing some community service and they would probably like the help, but what do you think the other kids who don't wan' t to do community service will react to you saying all students now have to do community service. the kids who have to do might try to get their parents to let them drop out of school, because i wouldn't want to do community service.if you make the kids do community service the community might get into better shape than it already is. you also have to think that kids wouldn't have enough time to get some of their homework finished or be able to go to their after school activities. i think that if you make the kids do it they wouldn't, you would have to punish them for not doing the community service so that would just make the students made at you. the parents are a very hard subject. some of the parents might like their kids going out and doing some community service instead of being home all of the time, but there are other parents that probably wouldn't like their kids being away from home any longer than being at school.the teachers at school are also a very big subject. they wouldn't be able to give out as much homework so they would intern have to do more work at school. doing more work at school would also mean the students would be less happy than they already were knowing that they have to come home just for more community service they had to do. there are some teachers that pretty much just give out homework and that would ruin there whole school year curriculum.that is my argument about making kids volunteer for community service. truthfully who wants to do more work than they already have to do. in my opinion school work is very hard without knowing you will have to go home knowing that after working all day at school the students just have to go home and work more.sincerely, student",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

E12450BAE343,"would it be surprising to know that kids learning at home helps them not stress out as much? stress is mainly caused by student getting to much school work that cannot all be handied in on night. every day kids complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. students being educated at school gaing more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. learning at home and not at schools helps kids succeeed and have better grades.one of the best thing about homeschooling is that it can be done at anytime, and anywhere. children have a flexible time schedule which means that the parents can help. the students can work around the parents schedule instead of the parents working around the student's schedule. some students have a trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pase set by teachers. homeschooling allows students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. another thing about homerschooling is that there are no misguided rules about technology or how to dress. this is good because instead of worrying about the rules. the students can focus on their studies.when you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. this is another reason that learning from home would benefit students. learning from home won't have the distractions that a classroom has. as a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. one of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment their are not familiar with, which makes the feel uncomfortable. if a students learns from home they will feel more relaxed and confortable and won't stress about work. in a school, you are struck at desk for 6 hours and have a limited time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. this is not help a student's learning at all. on the other hand. if you are at home you can eat and do whatever you want when you want.there are still a few reasons not to do distanced learning. there are many more opportunities with public schools. people from different colleges don't go to students'homes and try to advertise their career options. making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. public school are great places to socialize during free time. if everyone goes home to attend school funding for public schooling willl fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of buged cuts. in public schools, depending an the teachers, cheating is hard to do.my conclusion is students should be offered classes online or at home because the environment is less distracting, which could be less stressful. at home there are less distractions, rather than at school where there are many different thing to students, can greatly affect the quality of a student's work.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

EA441360E42C,"can you believe that schools are now making students stay after-school to participate in an extracurricular activity. i disagree with schools having students participate in one extracurricular activity becasuse students need time for other activities outside of school, students need time with their families, and they need time to do their homework.many students love coming home right when the school bell rings and having the rest of the day to do what they like. this is not the case at some schools. at my school our principal is having us participate in one extracurricular activity. i disagree with this because students need time to play and practice sports such as basketball, baseball, hockey, and soccer. students also need time to hang out with their friends not just inside of school, but outside too. if a student is forced to stay after-school and there is nothing they like there than it may bother the students emotions and make them sad. if a student is sad or upset about this it may affect their participation, attendence, and effort. i do not want kids spending more time than they have to at school.there are a ton of students who do not get to see their family at all due to school. students need time to be with their family and socialize with them like playing a board game or having a nice conversation. extracurricular activities may interfere with the time that kids have to spend with their families. it is very important that kids spend time with their families because it keeps their mental health well, keeps them in line, and provides comfort for them. it keeps their mental health stable because they do not worry about seeing their parents or when they will see their parents again. it keeps them in line because they have somebody to tell them what is ok and what is not ok and they have somebody to discipline them. it provides comfort for kids because they know somebody or some group of people are there for them. if students had no time to spend with their family it would most likely casue many problems for them.did you know that teachers assign kids with loads of homework? if you didn't then now you do. here at my school i get home and it takes me a couple of hours to get my homework done. i was very disappointed when i was told that every student has to take part in one extracurricular activity. if this time is taken away from students it will take away time for them to do their homework. if kids start not having time to do their homework their grades may drop, which could make them depressed, and it could affect their behavior at school. if a students grade drops their parents may get mad which would make them sad and upset which could lead to them doing something hurtful or bad to themselves. it could also affect their behavior at school by making them not pay attention and start getting into mischief. if students have to stay after-school for an extra activity, it takes away time for homework which kids need to do and if they dont have the time bad things may happen.once again, i believe that students should not be forced to participate in one extracurricular activity at school because they need time for other activities outside of school, time to spend with their families, and time to do their homework. if time that students have for these activities gets taken away by school it may lead to something bad. if you do not agree with me please think about this again and if you do agree with me that is great because you are thinking the right way.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0

0839B4ACC2AF,"summer projects are given to students so they can continue to learn and not fall behind in the coming school year. but would it help if the summer projects are created by teachers? well yes, teachers have been teaching and making projects for a long time and they would know what they are doing. as a high school student i could prefer that my teacher makes the projects verse some student who not much of an expert on the topic. summer projects should be teacher-designed because they have more experience, the project can be less confusing, and the project can give the student an insight of what the class will be like.teachers have received many years of training on how to work with students and how to help them understand and learn many topics. with so much experience and training they would know how to design a project that will allow the students to continue to learn through out the summer. for example, i am taking ap chemistry and there was a summer assignment. this assignment was created by the teacher and it was easy to comprehend and do. this made my experience with working on the project much more productive and less time consuming.projects that are created by teacher can be more straight forward and to the point. teachers know the topic better than any student which would create less confusion and less room for mistakes. many of the projects that i have done were mostly teacher-designed and they were easy to understand and finish without too many hurdles. if there were to be any confusion it would be much easier to contact the teacher about a question than a student. when there are less mistakes in the project it would be more time effective and one would be able to finish the project faster.when the teacher is creating the project, they would have in mind how the syllabus would look like for the coming year. teachers are most likely to create a project that would reflect the syllabus. this would help students to be prepared for the coming year and they would also know what to expect. for instance, when i had received a summer project for ap statistics as i was doing the project i was able to understand more about what statistic is and how the class work would be like. however, if a student were to create the project it might not have given a picture of how the class would be like through out the year.in conclusion, schools should have summer projects that are designed by teachers. this way students would be more benefited due to the teachers knowledge on the topic. when the teachers do create the project there will be more clarity on what the student should do. the students will also be able to get a feel of the class in the coming year.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
18EDFBD73F06,"i personally think that when you need advice you should ask more than two of your close friends, i say this because not all friends give good advice and by asking a friend that doesnt give good advice you put yourself at risk of them giving you bad advice and it steers you into the wrong direction. this happened to me and it put me into a situation i didn't want to be in. it all started when i asked one of my closest friends to help me out with a situation i was in with my best friend at the time, my best friend was mad at me for some unknown reason and i had no clue what to do she never responded to my texts and she wouldn't talk to me when i saw her in person. i was really worried considering she was my best friend and she meant everything to me. when i asked my close friend what to do she told me to just to ignore the problem until my best friend got over it, and i for some dumb reason listened to her. after a while my best friend got even more upset that i wasnt trying to resolve the situation and she called me and said that she never wants to be friends with me again, and that really hurt my feeling. but i couldn't help but think if i asked 2 more of my close friends i wouldn't have been in that situation and they would have told me to talk it over with my then best friend.the second reason people should ask more than one friend is not all of your so called ""friends"" wants whats best for you. i learned that when my close friend gave me the awful advice of ignoring a problem with my best friend until it ""went"" away, i later learned she told me to do that because she was jealous of the relationship i had with my best friend at the time. so she purposely gave me bad advice so she could have me all to herself, and thats when i realized not all ""friends"" have your back. so thats why you have to make sure your asking a true friend for advice.that leads into my next point that you should make sure your asking true friend that you know you can count on when you want advice. this has to be someone that you trust and you know only wants the best for you, because if you dont take a step back and dont see those qualities in your ""friend"" you shouldnt be going to that person for advice, and if you dont't realize at the time that that person dosn't want the best for you, you have your other people to aske for advice. this brings be back to the prompt on my you should seek multiple opinions when needing advice. in my i said why youshould seek/ask multiple people for advice when needed.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

00B144412785,"dear florida senator,i would like disuss why changing up the way we voyte today is not as bad f an idea as it sounds. changing to elections by a popular vote sounds like its in the peoples hands instead of juts casting out votes on the slate electors. aren't we voting for our president. innstead of countting onn the electoral votes to hep out or, go against out favor, it'd be much more easier to just let the people vote.the elctoral votes are utterly useless or unimportant,though. if there is ever happens to be a tie between the two candidates the electoral votes can help break it. it'd be less of a hassle to have the florida residents vote,directly, on someone besides the president. less worring about if theyre going to win or not. now when you start to think about it the electoral college is just unfair an pretty outdated,if you ask me. change doesn't sound that bad. all im trying to achive by writting this, is to gain actual control over who we're all voting for.it's also not just what's completely wrong with the electoral college but how does it help in the first place? when you start analizing it, it really doens't help much. how much actual help can the lectora coellge make, in my defense not much. why? simple, its just 20-30 more votes and not many states have that much hawaii has uop to 4 electoral votes, not much. voters should be alowed to directly vote for who they want to be president and not rely on the lectoral college.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5

CCA7A1220DA0,"how getting and asking for multiple opinions can help you make a better decisionhave you ever had to make an important life decision? it can be very difficult, depending on the impact of your decision, to choose right away. as a result, you might ask your peers to give you advice to make the right choice. you may find that you agree with some people and disagree with others. other times you might have to meet in the middle and find pros and cons about everyone's opinion and then make a decision with that information. like i said, not easy right? however, if you ask multiple people for advice on your decision, you can gain multiple points of view, you might find it easier to make your decision with other opinions, and you might find a better option through multiple opinions rather than just one.first and foremost, you can gain multiple points of view. everyone has a different way of thinking. your best friends way of thinking is very different than yours. sometimes you might have the smarter idea, sometimes they will have the smarter idea. i know if i had to make a big, life-changing decision that i would ask all of my closest friends. i can recall one time when i was making a personal decision about a year ago, and i did not know what to do. i asked my closest friends what i should do, and almost all of them responded just about how i expected them to. most of them said they wanted to see me happy, so they encouraged me to choose the decision that would make me the happiest. others gave me facts, pros and cons, and why they would be disappointed if i made one decision over the other. they then told me that they believed in me, and i would eventually make the right decision. having those multiple points of view on what they thought really helped me decide on what i should do. i think if i had not have asked them for advice, i would have made a decision i would have regretted.secondly, if you ask for multiple opinions, you might be find it easier to make your decision with opinions other than your own. sometimes when a decision is very impactful, you can get stressed out over the choice you want to make. asking others may make deciding easier because all you have to honestly do is listen to their ideas and decide if you agree with them or not. then, using your common sense and their advice, you can choose the decision you believe is best for you . also, you actually might know what you are going to choose. but you might still want to ask other people what they think because that can ""confirm"" that you have made the right decision.lastly, when you get advice from multiple people, you can find a better option than you originally thought. let's say you have weighed your options of certain decisions that you think are the right decisions. you chose what you think, in your mind, is best. you then ask your friends for their opinion, and suddenly everyone is saying everything different than what you thought. all of your wonderful thoughts are suddenly crushed with a wrecking ball. after listening to all of their thoughts, you find some are much more brilliant than yours. you then go back and completely rethink your decisions, just because of those few opinions. after extensive thought, you decide that your original idea was bogus. when you first make a decision, even if you had thought about for a long time, the stress of making a decision quick can sometimes fog your thinking. that is why having other people's opinions can help you make the right decision, even if it is the second time trying to choose what is best for you.all in all, having people help you is very, very important. i believe if i did not have people help me, not even just give me advice, that i would not do my best in school. we as humans need other humans! it's just how it goes. asking for advice is a pretty normal thing to do. when asking for advice, remember it can only positively effect you by giving you different points of view, help you make a better decision, and you possibly can find a better choice than you originally thought.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

28A7B5B9219E,"dear principal,the school policy that you have decided upon is necessary that students must have a grade b average to play sports is not a good idea in my mind. many students are at a grade c average and are playing meaning that they are already trying their best to be in the sports.when a student is pushed a little to do better they react accordingly but, when they are pushed to across their limit they tend to feel overwhelmed and agitated. this overwhelming feeling can lead to procrastination and laziness, which will lower their grades which would then lead to a domino effect until they are failing. this could happen or the student would feel that they do not need to go to school anymore because they have nothing to look forward to there. then the student may influence others and create a ring of truancy which is worse than low grades.the students who enjoy these extracurricular activities usually are concentrating on doing their best in sports or their extracurricular activities, if we could move their priorities without side effects we could be able to reach higher levels of learning although a grade b average sounds like the best thing to do for this, it is not. sometimes when students have a large load of homework or tests they feel the need to relax and forget about their stress, but if they need to get even higher grades the outcome would be either of these three extremes, extremely low grades, truancy, high grades (but not enough time for sports) without a lot of time students agitation would reach to a point where they might resort to drastic efforts to relieve stress, like suicide. this would then mold the school into an unfriendly jail cell, and other students will be effected.instead of a grade b average as the policy, you should have a tutor at the extracurricular activities who can put in a little bit of teaching while the students are having fun. the connection of fun and learning can lead grade c average students to achieve higher grades and do better in school. also if you can design rewards for students with higher grades the students with low grades will want to reap from the tree of knowledge to receive rewards, this in turn will yield higher grades, less procrastination, less anger, and all without any harmful side effects.sincerely,student_name",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

""the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor"" this sentence from the ""suburb, life goes on without cars"" explains that it is very peaceful because theres no noise, no pollution and much more healthier people because they ride bikes everywhere and walk alot, and theres no pollution so theres probably people who dont have breath in nasty air of cars. even the environmental protection agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are even starting to do the same.people that have no cars most likely walk alot and ride bikes, or even run, well because of that the amount of stress people have is probably very low, because of low stress people are happier, and thats because excersize relieves stress and even reduce headaches or other health problems. even the death rate will go decrease because there will less car accidents, and car accidents are the numer one reason of death and the united states. in bogota they were in their third year where cars were banned but only buses and taxis were permitted for the day without cars in this capital city of 7 million. their goal is to promote alternative tranportation to reduce nasty smog and violators faced a $25 fines, the turnout of this was large, despite the gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers. ""the rain hasnt stopped people from participating,"" said the mayor of bogotain conclusion the advantages of limited cars are great and the people of car-less cities or areas are much happier without them, people are healthier, less stressed and even have less health problem due to it, but who will save the cats from climbing trees? maybe they wont climb it because of no pollution or scary car noises.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0

""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" that example shows that we don't need technology to figure out one's emotions. even though, its a great invention would be even use it. its not appropriate to use in a classroom setting. a teacher using that just to see what the kids' emotions are on the lesson. the teacher could just look at them and see how they feel towards this.the teacher would probably say that it would be useful for that technology. some students probably wouldn't mine but others would. students don't like to show their emotions sometimes. then all of a sudden a teacher can just tell your emotions in a second. the students would probably feel uncomfortable, because the teacher can see how they are feeling. feelings or emotions are meant for that certain person. that certain person can show off his/her emotions to other students around them.also where would you even put the emotional expression technology, because having a huge thing in the front of the classroom would be a distraction. that technology is also a distraction, because students would mess around with it when they probably aren't supposed too. also the students would keep asking the teacher what their emotions are. ""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" that quote sounds like its better than a teacher, because it can read the emotions and tell when the students get bored so they can change it.the invention would be nice, but not in a classroom settings. its just not appropriate there. in the story, it makes you do a little motions with your face. this is demonstrating that the technology will use the muscular part of your face to determine your emotions at that current time. the technology is cool on how it works and operates, but reading the students' muscular emotions would not be right.towards the end of the text, they said they used it for a theatre thing. that is an appropriate place to use it, because you are supposed to show a lot of emotions there. also they could read your emotions and help improve them because the technology told you what the emotion mostly was. the technology does reveal a lot about the science of emotions, but other places would have better use on it.some students like to hide their emotions from the teacher or other students. some don't want people to know what they are feeling, because its their own business. students wouldn't want their teachers walking up to them asking what is wrong, and the students said something like how do you know there is something wrong. then the teacher says i used the emotional expression technology. the student would just feel awkward, because the teacher just figured out their emotions when they probably wanted to keep it to themselves. this is why the use of technology to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

490867E5D019,"some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. schools argue whether projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. they both have benefits and different impacts on students. however, summer projects should be teacher-designed, because teachers can integrate what they will teach and they also have professional experience.one main reason summer projects should be teacher-designed is that teachers can integrate what they will be teaching. a small, but very important thing teachers have in common is that they have a lesson plan. a lesson plan is what teachers utilize to understand what curriculum they will teach and how they will teach it. as a result, the teacher can use the curriculum as their foundation of the project. for example, the international baccalaureate, ib, program requires students to complete a summer reading project. as an ib student, i had to complete it this past summer. we had a list of books to choose from, and we had to write an essay about the message of the book and make a poster about what we learned from the book. what i didn't realize, was that the book had a connection to what we were going to learn in class. the project helped the students make a connection to the class and learn faster and more efficiently. this results would not be possible, if a student designed the project so this is why summer project should be designed by a teacher.another reason summer projects should be teacher-designed is, because they have more professional experience than students. teachers most go to college to become teachers and be hired by a school. this means: they have a degree on education, are certified to be teachers, and they understand the subject better than students. in addition, they have experience from previous years and students. so they understand that students learn differently. consequently, they can come up with a method to make the project educative and impactful for every student; regardless, of how different they learn. for these reasons, the summer projects should be teacher designed.some may argue that summer projects should be student-designed, because students understand each other. while this statement is true it is bias. it's bias, because students are often with their friend group which often understand each other. on the other hand, friend groups are all different, meaning they have different beliefs and values. another reason, the statement is bias is that students have different learning styles. a student can be a fast learner and don't need to study as hard as others students; however, another student might need more reinforcement to learn. so if a student was to design a project it would be based on their personal preference and not about everyone. concluding, that summer projects should not be designed by students because they can be bias.as a conclusion, summer projects have to be teacher-designed. it must be designed by teachers, so students can learn efficiently and effectively. also, it can help the teacher understand and get to know the student through their summer project.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5

E10D5E79B0A0,"in the article ""making mona lisa smile,"" the author explains how certain algorithms built into a system, called the facial action coding system, can detect human emotions. in the article, the author describes how a classroom computer can recognize when a student is getting bored or confused based on their facial expressions. this computer can change the way that the lesson is being taught so that the students are more productive in classes. while the facial action coding system detects facial expressions that indicate a person's emotion, the system built in a classroom computer is valuable to students, because it can manipulate the lesson based on how students are learning.the ability to have a classroom computer that is able to read the emotional expressions of students, would be very valuable is a classroom, because it allows the lesson to be taught in a way that would benefit the students, according to dr. huang. in a normal classroom, teachers create lessons that confuse the students or do not appeal to their learning ability which creates a tension for the learning environment. with the use of this technology, classroom lessons would be more educational and responsive. this is because, the technology is able to recognize when a student is confused or bored by reading their emotional and facial expressions. this is useful since the system can alter a lesson plan to be suitable for the students in the classroom which would potentially help them learn better. for example, if a student is confused during class, it is likely that they will not ask for help, leading them to not understand what is going on in the lesson. having this technology in the classroom, would sense this and modify the lesson so that a student would be able to learn better and understand the topics.the use of the facial action coding system in classrooms would be beneficial in classrooms to both the students and the teacher, because it would allow the teacher to adjust lessons in order for more students to understand the concepts. dr. huang predicted that the system would be able to manipulate lessons based on the readings of emotional expressions in the classroom. the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, because it would benefit the student's learning ability in the classroom.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

""each pixel in the 2001 image spans 156 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1978 viking photo"".so from all of the information from this article it is confirmed that ""the face"" isn't really a extraterestrial artifact, but just a measly illusion.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0

FB56AA75F65F,"when someone needs advice, would it be beneficial for them to ask more than one person? since people have different beliefs, opinions, and understandings, they do not think the same way all of the time. there are numerous reasons why getting advice from multiple people can be advantageous including some people could be more educated in the topic than others and every person will have a different perspective.one reason why asking multiple people for advice could help someone make a decision is because one person might have a better understanding of the topic than the others who have been asked. if someone who does not know much about the topic is asked, they might not give the best, up-to-date answer. however, someone who is knowledgeable in that specific area will probably be able to connect with the subject and give better advice to help. for example, if someone asks what color the sky is, one person could say it is red, and another person could say that it is purple, but a scientist that was asked could say that it is blue. the scientist would be more educated on this subject. therefore, they would be able to provide the more helpful answer. if the one asking had only talked to one person, it is more likely that they would get an incorrect answer or a response that is not as beneficial. overall, asking multiple people for advice could benefit someone by providing them with a better, more educated answer.another reason why getting advice from multiple people could be advantageous is because every person that is asked will feel differently about the topic. some people will feel positively about the topic while others feel negatively. people have their own opinions and their opinions are how they form an answer. for instance, if someone asks someone else for advice on where they should go for dinner, the action relies on the answer that the person gives. if they say that they should go to a certain restaurant, it could be because the person giving advice likes that restaurant. on the other hand, if the person asks multiple people, they will get a variety of answers because everybody has a different opinion. the more people that someone asks, the more answers that they will get. therefore giving them a plethora of opinions to base their choice off of.there are many reasons why someone should ask multiple people for advice including getting a more educated answer and receiving different opinions. asking more than one person would provide someone with better advice and a variety of answers. whether somebody asks two or five people, all of the answers that are given will lead them to make better choices.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

FBE13E9A446C,"dear florida state senator,although many could argue that the electoral college is a fair system of deciding the president, far too many people consider it non-democratic and unefficient for it it continue being our way of electing our leader. a new system of election must be created to make up for the pitfalls that are inevitable in the electoral college. a country that is supposed to be a democracy does not have the voting system that such a proud democracy deserves.defenders of the college may say that the possibility of a tie is very low or that the  electors chosen are confirmed not to betray the wants of the voters, but just because the possibility is low does not mean you can simply allow the flaws in the voting system to exist. a small hole in a fabric can only grow bigger, and the same goes for our electoral college. if we can't repair or replace the fabric that is our electoral college, soon there will be problems too big for us to deal with in our current state. the electoral voters may keep the public in mind for now, but there have already been cases where electoral voters put their own wants ahead of the public.one thing that the electoral college does not promote is the power in the hands of the people. although people can vote for whatever candidate they want, the elector is the real deciding hand in the process of picking our president. if one wanted to, an elector can completely disregard the decision of the voters and choose who they want. considering the ratio of electors in some states to people, it seems completely non-democratic for the votes of some to be more important than the wants of the common people. some start to feel that they shouldn't vote because their one vote wouldn't have the power to change anything, and wouldn't even ensure the election of the president they want. another thing that lowers the morale is the absence of candidates in states that can't be won very easily. if a candidate is pretty sure he can't win over a state, he won't visit it because it wouldn't be worth his time. he also wil prioritize large states over small ones because they have more electoral votes. all of these can make a state or person feel as if the election isn't really in their hands, and when people feel like their vote doesn't matter, they don't vote.besides the power it takes away from the common man, some could say that the system itself is very inefficient compared to what it could be. even though it has a very low possibility, the fact is that a tie is possible due to the electoral college having an even number of votes. it would then go to the house of representatives, who might not even have the want of the people in mind. since most of the time congress has a party that makes up a majority of it, it would be very unfair to allow them to pick the president. it's also possible that even if a majority of the people vote for a president, the electoral votes elect the other candidate instead, like what happened to al gore in 2000. an election like this just has too many holes and pitfalls to be efficient. the holes need to be repaired before we can actually use this as our primary way to select a president, or else we're setting ourselves up to have problems in the future.the electoral college may be functional, but is largely inefficient and is not in the best interest of the common people. the vote for a candidate is not even in the hands in the people, but rather a minority of chosen electors. in a country that prides itself on the power the people have, and the control they have on how their country is run, the people have surprisingly less influence than you would think. we as a people need to speak up against the overrated system that is the electoral college, and develop a system that fits the needs of a true democracy like america should be.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

88FC05DDCC92,"dear principal,i realize some people may think that community service is a waste of time, a distraction from work or friends and family, but i can assure you that community service is greatly needed. it doesn't matter that it may take time away from work or other jobs, we all need to give back now and then. we ,as a community, cant have a ""well-someone-else-should-do-it"" attitude, because if we all thought that then nothing would ever get done. in these times, when some people are working two jobs just to feed their family, and we have so much extra, it would be selfish and greedy of us not to give back.community service doesn't have to be boring either, there are lots of fun ways to give back to our community. for example, you could go to a animal shelter and help walk and feed the animals. or you could go to a nursing home and play games with the seniors there. i'm sure they would also love to have someone sit and just listen to them tell a story or two. there are lots of fun ways to help out that don't include getting dirty or being outside.but if someone felt like they wanted to do more laborious work then there are other jobs they can do as well. they could help clean up garbage at a beach. they could help redo a local park by putting in bark dust or planting trees. also, they could find a nice local garden or farm that had some jobs that needed to be done. there could be non-profit organizations that need some volunteers with events or charities as well.but it doesn't matter whether you are outside or inside as long as you are trying your best to help out. i think that if you didn't have the students at our school do community service you would be doing them a great injustice. when we are so privileged to have a nice home, clean water, and a meal on the table every night we should at least be able to go out for an our or two and help someone else who isn't as privileged. its hardly a great burden to get up from the computer or desk you are at, put on a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt, and go out and help. so i ask only one thing of you; please set aside one day, one measly day, to have all of the students in our school wander out into the community and help someone. thank you and i hope you take my letter into consideration while you make your decision.sincerely,student_name",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
FAF91DDF582C,"some schools require students to complete summer projects to guarantee that students will continue to learn during their summer break. it is essential that students keep learning even though they are taking a break from school, but these summer projects should be teacher-designed. why should a students not be allowed to choose a project of their liking? well, the student's teacher will know what that person needs to work on. if a student were to choose what they would like their project to be about, they could probably decide to work on something that does not require much effort; therefore, it would be best if a professional particularly assigned a certain topic to help his or her pupil designated to help them grow and become more efficient in their academic life. however, if the student believes that there is a specific topic they believe they need to practice more than the teacher should consider to make an exemption.students would certainly benefit if they were given homework over summer. this action would ensure that the student will be ready to tackle classroom assignments once they are back to school. not only that but it would also let the student perfect their skills and be prepared in class. these projects designated to students will surely boost the alumni's knowledge and confidence on that specific topic. therefore, the student will not struggle as much as they would have without the extra help.in addition, if teachers assign students particular homework designed to help their alumni be more efficient in class, it is undeniable that their student's classroom performance will have a positive effect in their academic life. the teacher ,being a professional, will have more understanding of what their student needs to work on. he or she can personalize the project to better help the student understand and learn about their assignment. the extra help given to the alumni will have positive results and they could use their knowledge acquired by the project on other classes, or these young adults can use this information outside of school to help them handle outside of school life situations. if trained professionals give students homework during summer break, then those students will be able to see how this extra work helped them master skills when school opens again.students should not be given the privilege to choose their own project assignments. some students would pick easy topics that would not require them to put much effort, this will deeply harm the student academically. instead of working hard to perfect an area in which the student struggles, they would rather choose something that is easy and would get done quickly. this is why it is better if teachers gave students their assignments. however, it can not be guaranteed that the students will learn or understand the homework assignment. for that reason could be that maybe the student is not ready to take on that particular topic. without a doubt, it is known that not all students learn the same way and not all understand what they have learned. everybody learns at their own pace and in their own way. if the student believes that the designated work is too hard, or maybe too easy, then they should talk to their teacher and suggest a different topic. also, if the students thinks that there is another area they need to practice more, they should ask their teacher to consider their request.schools that require students to continue learning during the summer will see positive results in students academic lives. designated work from teachers will greatly help alumni master and perfect classroom skills. not to mention, students will acquire more knowledge on these areas with the extra help that was provided. if the teacher knows what their students need to work more on, those students will soon be ready to take on anything once school is in cession again. if students were given the liberty to pick their projects, would the students actually learn from it? what happens if the student chooses an easy project, when they could have been working on some other topic that they know they have trouble with? this will certainly not be a good idea. as professionals, teachers know what is best for their students if they have been observing their classroom performance. however, many teachers sometimes overlook a few things in which student have trouble with. when this happens the student should take a step forward and let their teacher know what it is they think they need to work. this way the teacher can look back and verify is this person does need to practice more in the areas that they may be struggling.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

FC79A84D783B,"the electoral college has its pros and cons. either keeping the electoral college or changing it to election by popular vote for the presidents of the u.s. will have its disadvantages and advantages of course. so, why keep it if the people don't actually pick the president?one of the reasons why the electoral college should be changed is because its not democratic. the voters don't vote for the president, they actually vote for a slate of electors who are the ones who elect the president. ""because of the winner-take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states"" - by bradford plumer. its not fair that some states won't even have a saying in choosing the president. everyone should have a saying even if the candidates in the winner-take all system don't want to spend their time. we live in a democratic country we should be allowed to choose the persident instead of the electoral college. its unfair and irrational that the electors choose the president instead of the people.the electoral college does help the elections avoid run-off elections. larger states will always get more attention in a campaign than a small state. this is because larger states have a bigger population than small states.""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"". -by richard a. posner. just because not everyone pays close attention to the competing campaign. it doesn't been they shouldn't be treated differently than the ones who do. everyone should be treated equally no matter what there opinion or choice is.my opinion about if we should keep or change the electoral college is biased. i don't think we should keep or even change it for the president to be elected by a populr vote. the electoral college helps weight the political balance in large states. it also doesn't allow the people to vote for the president. either way i would be fine with whatever decision happens to the electoral college. i can't chose a way to argue about it cause i go both ways with my arguements.in overal the electoral college has its advantages and disadvantages. it all depends in everyones point of view. people should be treated equally about the decision they made. let the people be able to choose the president of the united states its a right they have don't take it away from them because it wouldn't be fair to them. we live in a democratic country and the people have the power.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
B0C80C0550D7,"in 1976, the viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet of mars, and it was taking new pictures for all of mankind to see. as it was passing over a strip of mars called cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. this new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. a few days later nasa reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit. conspiracy theorist were fast to make speculations that this was ancient alien architecture or something of the sort. but nasa said that the face was just a geograghical coincidence, and there is no alien stucture on mars.one reason that consiracy theorist could beleive that this could be an alien stucture is that the resolution of the first picture was very low. in paragraph 10 it says,"" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo."" this shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on mars. soon later nasa and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 global surveyor spacecraft. this new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the ""face on mars"". the pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of cydonia this time. the new photos clearly showed a landform on mars and not a man.but even after these new pictures conspiracy theorist were still bent on the idea that nasa was trying to cover something up. in spite of the new pictures people said that the day the photo was taken, it was cloudy. therefor the photos couldn't be very accurate. in fact, these theorists were right. the day the photo was taken was in winter. it says in paragraph 8 that, "" ... it was winter in april '98- a cloudy time of year on the red planet."" these facts show that the landmass could indead be hidden by clouds. however, nasa still supported their claim that it was just a misinterpreted natural landform.while nasa never spoke negatively about the theory, they set out again to prove it wrong. on april 8, 2001, the mars global surveyor came over the face on mars, and it took photos with a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel; the highest ever yet. what these pictures showed was what would be a butte or a mesa on earth. these landforms are very common in cydonia, so the pictures were very realistic. with very high resolutioned photos, it is hard for conspiracy theorists to still say that there is face on mars. it even says in paragraph 11,"" so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""in conclusion, the face on mars is supported and not supported. nasa has proven with photographic evidence that it is just a natural occurance while conspiracy theorists say that it is a martian civilization. i think that nasa's facts are very believable, and they have the science to back up their claim. i hope that in the future, more people will base their beleifs off of science and not fictional conspiracy theories.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
C4008B4496ED,"in 1976, the viking 1 set course to mars. when the viking 1 was orbiting mars, the mars global surveyor took a photo of a strange figure. it looked like a shadowy human face. the question everyone is asking is who are what made this? was it aliens or is it just natural. if you ask me, this strange looking thing is just a natural landform.i think it is a landform for a couple of reasons. my first reason is that only a few of my friends from nasa believe that this strange landform was really made by aliens. i also think that this is just a landform because the photo that we took was not very clear and that could have made the landform look like a face.i also think that this is just a land form because the time of year that we took the one of the photos. when we took the photo in 1998, we took the photo during the winter on mars and it made mars sort of cloudy and the mars global surveyer had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the strange landform. some of my friends from nasa were saying that some of the so called ""alien markings"" were hidden too.my final reason for thinking that this is just a landform is that when we took the thre pictures and compared them, they all looked different from each other. the picture we took in 1976 looked like the face the most out of the three pictures. the picture we took in 1998 did not have the same details of the first picture and it did not look like a face. the picture we took in 2001 did not have the facial features of the first photo either. therefore, i think this is just a landformin conclusion, i think this is just a landform because only a few of my friends believed that it was done by aliens, the photo we took in 1998 was different due to some of the factors of weather, and all three photos looked different from one another.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

3C4368A07D88,"dear principal,i've heard you are deciding whether to require all students to perform community service. i'm aware some students think that community service is a waste of time. i completely support this plan.community service is away to interact with other people and helping them out. students will be able to learn new things that could help them out in the future. they will also be distracted with better things than getting bored and doing something irresponsible.first of all some students get to caught up with work they don't have time to interact with others. community service can help students with that by helping others and not feeling so alone. like this one girl i knew was so caught up with her studies all she did then was go into her room and lock herself up. later , when i noticed she'd gone too far i told her to help me clean up the streets that were covered in litter. she did and then from then on she found time for her work, friends, and community service.next, do you the saying ""you learn something new everyday."" well its true with community service you can learn things you never knew before. one time my aunt went to a park because of an oil spill and she helped out with cleaning the damage. while she was there someone who knew a lot about wild life taught her about the different species. later in life we went for a walk and on the streets we saw a snake that looked like a very poisonous one, but my aunt with her new knowledge of wildlife knew exactly what it was. good thing she went to that park for community service and learned about different animals.lastly, haven't you ever gotten bored. everyone gets bored anytime. well some students may get involved with something wrong while they are bored. sometimes students get into drugs but instead of that they could do something useful. community service can help keep kids of drugs and do something good.of course i get bored all the time but when i do i usually help other people like mowing the lawn, gardening, babysitting and its all fun.so as you can i completely support your plan for requiring students do community service. it can help them for later on in life you never know. learning new things and not getting into the wrong things is very important. thank you for taking the time for reading my letter.sincerely,student",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5

2446D9BE78B8,"some people do not see the need to spend the effort in questioning multiple people to gather information and opinions, but it is a crucial step in research. they see it as only an extra step that can be skipped over without thought, but in reality, only seeking information from one person leads to incorrect, biased information. though it takes time, seeking advice from multiple sources allows for more information and different viewpoints, leading to a better outcome.different people have different viewpoints and opinions. if you only seek advice from one person, you only see one side of what could happen, rather when you ask multiple sources, you're given a greater sense of what to do and how to go about it. according to the new york research center for populations and society, on a societal level, nothing but basic morals are agreed on and considered to be universally accepted. what is accepted in the united states may not be considered normal in india, or the other way around. on a smaller scale, this may be less evident, but the research still applies to a great extent. if only one source is questioned, what they see as okay may not be seen the same way by another source. for this reason, it is hard for most people to switch societal views and morals. a study conducted by generic_name shows that when people are shown a different viewpoint, they tend to stick with it after being presented a new one later. when you do not get more than one perspective on a matter, you have the tendency to use whatever you were taught to make choices, and not accept changing to a more reliable choice.another key reason to gather information from multiple sources is that you do not know the accuracy of the information gathered when only from one person. they may have learned the information incorrectly, which can lead to bad advice. as an example, lets say a new mother was seeking advice on how to raise their child safely. according to the family and consumer science program, 68% of people under the age of 25 do not have antiquate information on how to perform childcare duties. if that mother were to ask one of her unqualified friends, she could be presented with false information. that friend may of thought they were qualified to give information. a second study performed by generic_name shows the less qualified people are, to more they tend to think they are qualified. that could mean you are getting advice from an unreliable source, and most likely your course of action will be worse.a similar reason to seek advice from multiple people is bias. bias can be hard to detect in many cases, especially when the thing biased to is smaller and less prevalent. research done by the california critical thinking and development organization, 72% of people were unable to identify bias in articles. for what seems like such a simple skill, it is surprising in the amount of people who are unable to preform it. taking to multiple sources makes bias easier to identify, because more conflict will occur in the information. one source may leave out information to angle the evidence, while the other states all the evidence. even in cases where bias in unavoidable, taking to multiple sources may provide better results. as generic_name, a researcher for the university of oklahoma states, ""researching biased topics may prove challenging, but combining evidence together to rid the bias is a helpful strategy in reducing the nonfactual information.""as all evidence suggests, taking advice from multiple people is the right course of action to receive the best information. when people only take advice from one person, they allow for many mistakes and mishaps. next time you are trying to make a decision that will have the best outcome, rather than only asking for advice from one person, take advice from multiple and gather as much information about the topic as possible. the more information you have, the more likely you are to make the correct choice.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

B0CCFA21F82C,"my principal says we all have to participate in at least one after school activity. i totally agree with him. one of the reasons why is so we can make more friends and be more comfortable aorund people. the reason why we need to have friends and be more comfortable around people is because friends are always a important part of a persons life. comfort is also really important because most jobs involve people and if you're uncomfortable around people that could be a problem. one of my other reasons is because it helps you with communicaton. for example you can't always be right or get the last word. if one person feels sad and everyone else is happy it's unfair to have one person so we have to consider their feelings too. therefore i feel like communication is very important because without it it's very hard to do group activities. the last reason why i agree with our principal is because it allows you to have fun, having fun is very important because we are still young and still deserve to have fun doing the stuff we love with the people we love. if we aren't having any fun as a young person we most likely won't have very much fun older. not having could lead to sadness which isn't a good thing. it also gives us motivation to get through the day because we know at the end of the day we get to do the thing we love most. these are my reasons why i agree with my principal.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
D5A0A8C83A60,"distance learning gives students hope for the future. incorporating distance learning for students gives them a chance to stay on track with the rest of their classmates from home when circumstances disallow them from coming to school. some people might say there are no benefits from distance learning, however, they are wrong because distance learning reduces chances of receiving or giving illnesses and gives students a chance to not fall behind in school. students will benefit from being able to attend school from home because they won't get behind when they miss school and it reduces likelihood of getting yourself or others sick.distance learning benefits students that are unable to go to school because they won't fall behind when they return and allows for time to complete assignments independently. in 8th grade, i went on vacation for a week during the school year. when i returned to school, i had numerous of classwork assignments and tests that i had to make up. this was difficult to complete because i was expected to study for tests, finish assignments, and continue to learn new material simultaneously. distance learning would have benefited me in this situation because had i attended my classes through video conferencing during my vacation, the amount of work i would have to had completed when i returned would have been reduced. distance learning provides more time for students to work on assignments independently. a friend of mine, generic_name, constantly has a hard time concentrating in school. when she is home from school, she is able to complete her assignments more efficiently than she would have at school because there is less noise to distract her at home. distance learning is also beneficial for students who struggle in a school setting because it gives them a chance to attend class without becoming distracted of what's happening around them. some might say that distance learning does not help students who are unable to go to school, clearly, they are wrong because they won't fall behind in their absence and it gives students and alternate learning environment.attending classes from home can reduce the likelihood of getting others sick or becoming sick because it's impossible to spread germs from home and you are not aware of how clean your school is. currently, their is an virus spreading that has resulted in a pandemic in the united states. many colleges and universities have decided to extend spring breaks and move classes online as a result of the flu-like disease. to prevent the spreading of this virus, schools decided this would be the safest option for their students because many students have gone out of the country for break and can possibly bring the virus back with them. this provides students who traveled time to be tested and cleared for school if necessary. since most people have cleaned and cooked in their own house, they are aware of what they are eating, breathing, and touching. students are unaware of what is done to clean the school or cook lunch food. last year, i was eating a chicken sandwich from the lunch line that didn't appear cooked completely. i didn't think much of it until i went to the doctor and found out i received food poisoning. if i knew what was contained in the sandwich, i wouldn't have been sick. i realized that you can't always trust what you are eating or touching when you don't know how it was made or what it contains. you are aware of and immune to your house, but you aren't fully aware of how they clean in, cook in, or maintain a school. some may say that distance learning won't reduce the likelihood of getting others sick or becoming sick, however, they are wrong because distance learning prevents wide-spread illnesses from affecting students and students are not aware of how safe school is for their health.students will benefit from being able to attend schools from home because they won't get behind when they miss school and it reduces likelihood of getting yourself or others sick. distance learning gives students access to school without having to attend. this benefits students who are missing school because of vacation, prefer home as an alternative learning environment, and trying to prevent illnesses from spreading. if distance learning wasn't available for students who fall into one of these three groups, they would have a difficult school experience. distance learning is a great opportunity for students who want to attend school without having to deal with the consequences.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

B962DFFBD558,"seeking opinions can help you make better decisions. ""two brains are better than one."" see now everyone has heard this quote at least one time in their life. and that's because it's true! seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices because, more minds the better, different people from different cultures can have other ideas. and also it's good to have conversations about something that you're not sure on.more minds the better. you know all those tall buildings built in the city? yeah, those took many minds to make, over 1,000 engineers worked on the worlds tallest building. what if only one engineer made the design plans? i bet you it wouldn't even get past the drawing board. everyone has heard the ""we're stronger together"" or ""team work makes the dream work."" now, do you know everything about airplanes? i bet not, so that's why you would talk to someone that does know something about planes. 99% of engineers need someone else to work for them because they don't know something. see, that's a perfect example of a way that we need other people to help us by using their knowledge that they have and that we don't. but overall everyone is better together and not better divided.different people from different cultures can other backgrounds and ideas. you may think that one word is good, but then your friend from a different country might think that that word is horrible! see now no one person is the same so that's why sometimes if you have and opinion on something then maybe you should ask someone else that has a different cultural background from you. one thing that famous politicians do is check with other people with different backgrounds to make sure that they don't offend people when they don't want to. before you go out and start blabbing on about some other country maybe you should try and talk to the people from that country so then you don't offend them? you as a person will never be the same than anyone else. i personally have friends from other countries that eat dogs but look here, in the usa if someone eats a dog, that is very illegal. that's a perfect example of how people with other backgrounds will differ in opinions. so as you've read, most people that are different from you will widely differ in opinions from you.it's good to have conversations about something you're not sure on. everyone that is successful right now has asked at least one person for help, i can guarantee you that. so if you need help just ask! it's one of the best ways you can get help anyways. there are over 1,000 different information data bases that can help you find information on anything. one that i like is wikipedia it may not be 100% reliable but that's only if you're ignorant while reading it. wikipedia has over a million topics of information that you can browse. see this may not seem like your asking for help but it is one way you can. i only listed one good source of information but overall there is hundreds of sources for information and you can get help from any of them.but the best you can do is always seek for more information and keep on learning. that's why more than one person's advice is better only one person's advice. so i challenge you to go out into the world and to keep asking questions and to stay educated!",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

AD53B357BD0D,"have you ever had a really important decision you had to make? did you feel overwhelmed because you didn't know what you should do? asking for help or advise from people such as friends and family around you can really help alleviate all that stress. most people encounter big decisions often throughout their lives, so getting advise from numerous people can help you get more input on something, and may end up helping you make a final decision. seeking multiple opinions can really help someone make a better choice when dealing with decision making.one way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that by asking more than one person, they can get more input. asking numerous people can be a huge help when making an important decision. not only are people getting different ideas of what they may want to do, they can also get advise from people who may be more experienced than themselves. for example, if someone was debating on which college they should apply to, they may end up asking people such as older siblings or parents for advise because they may have more experience with that matter. by asking multiple people, you can get multiple ideas, each of them being different in their own way. by getting more people's input, you may be able to start to make your own choice about the matter because of the advise you've gotten.another way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by not getting any biased opinions. by asking more than one person for advise on a subject, they can get more than one new idea that isn't one of their own. this way, they can get more than one person's thoughts on the decision, and have different ideas on it. for example, if someone were trying to make a decision on what sport they may want to tryout for at school, they could possibly ask their friends and family about which they should choose. however, they should also ask people like classmates and teachers, as they may have their own ideas, and won't give the person any biased ideas or information. friends and family can have a great deal of influence on people, so it's important to always get people's thoughts that are on the outside. this will make it to where there's a greater chance of the decision maker not being biased, as they've heard numerous people's thoughts, and can make their own decision off of that.a final way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by being more prepared about the choice they're going to make. the decision maker can use all the advise they've gotten from different people to make their own choice, and feel better prepared. they will be more focused as they know what they want to do, and will feel more confident and less overwhelmed. feeling less overwhelmed can be a big help as the person doesn't have to be so worried, so they won't have any distractions from making the best possible decision. for example, if someone is trying to decide what kind of car they want to get, and they've gotten advise from numerous people, they can make a better choice when picking. they'll know exactly what they want, as they've heard many thoughts from the people around them, and so they can make their final decision.after getting advise from multiple people around them, the decision maker may be able to make the best choice possible, as they've gotten new thoughts and ideas. asking for help or for some advise from those around you can help you make the best possible choice because you've gotten a lot of new information and opinions that you wouldn't have gotten if you had only asked one or no one at all for advise. making an important choice can seem a little bit easier and less stressful after seeking advise from multiple people. getting help from others around you can help you make the best choice you can.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

50BCAECC0F0B,"everyone asks for help sometimes, but have you ever thought of asking more then one persons advice? asking more then one person helps you to make a better decision, people have different thought processes and listening to the way others think can be beneficial for you when decision making. using the wisdom of more then one person will allow you to see things in a different way then you had before.using two peoples different opinions can help you to better understand the way both sides think and why they think that way. before coming to a definite decision it is very helpful to have a complete understanding of both sides. this ensures that you pick the best possible choice. advice can be great especially when you want to please everyone with the choice that you made. you should try to please everyone with your decision, but be sure you listen to everyone before choosing.making final decision can be hard when you want to make sure everyone is happy with it. representing everyone can be difficult, but taking the advice of people with completely different points of view will help you. take the time that you need to choose, the decision may be hard but you can make compromises. you take advantage of the fact that you can use others opinions for help, and not only use yours. what everybody has to say matters so listen to everyone's advice, then make a final decision based off of what you all want.using advice from multiple people also helps you to avoid bias. if you had a very strong opinion on something, and you seek the advice of someone who thinks the opposite of you, you get a better understanding of why they think that way and can avoid bias. some important choices cannot be made with any bias, for example if you owned a company and needed to pick employees to hire picking your niece who as no experience in the field, nor any desire to work at your company is not a good choice. however using advice from other workers who help run the company you could find someone to pick with more experience and with desire to work there. bias in this case would not be good for your choice, so using others advice you can avoid it.using the advice of more then one person is a great help for you. it's something you should take advantage of so you make a good unbiased choice that is pleasing to everyone. listen to people and take their advice to make the best decision you possibly can.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

0CA9AC7879C9,"dear state senator, we should forget about the system of electorial college to vote for a president. it just isn't fair, reason why is beacause you are electing people to vote for the person who is trying to be president of the u.s although that doesnt mean that you both are voting for the same person that's trying to be president of the u.s. the electorial college system is corrupted and needs to stop being used to elect a president.to begin, in the source 2 they state the following ""60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" reasons why is because the electorial college is unfair it can make the person who had most of the votes lose because of the people who voted for the person to vote for a president choose the other runner up and make the person with the most votes actually lose. this is why people wish to have a direct election so they wont have to worry about their vote not going to the other runner up president.secondly, the reason why the electorial college is wrong is because we dont have our own voice; but the slate of electors do which can be pretty much anybody. for example in the article ""what's wrong with the electorial college"" they state (if you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for john kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors that pledged to kerry) these elctors can be anyone and still doesn't have to be voting for him though.although, if the people can rebalence the electorial college system then it can be somewhat a good thing. i can see how it can be somewhat balenced already; stated in the first source ""the whole electorial college has a total of 538 electors. the president you wish to elect has to have a majority of 270 electorial votes in order to win."" that means they need to have 270 more votes than the other president too.finally, so should the electorial college be abolished? unless people can find ways to limit the loosing president to come back with electoral votes, then yes this system should be banned.sincerly,proper_name",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
F038426B8B5A,"some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. projects are used to enhance learning in a different way. during the summer no student wants to work on school work or even think about school. i think that summer projects should be teacher- designed because students may take a while to come up with a project or idea, teacher- designed projects are already made and ready to go, projects would be less confusing when made by the teacher themselves.one reason i think that summer projects should be teacher-designed is because students may take a while to come up with ideas for the project or put it off. students are in school at least 8 to 9 months or for some students all year around, so when it comes to summer break students are ready to relax, go on vacation, or just sleep. students already have done tons of projects for classes or even just for one class and those projects are very stressful for some. summer in a lot of cases are relax time and forget about school time so when they are given a project to do a lot would just put it to the side and dont do it at all. when coming up with ideas on what to do some will not know or just not even try that's why it think it should be teacher-base.another reason that summer projects should be teacher-based is that teacher-based projects are already made in advance and are ready to go during summer and all the students have to do is follow the instructions of the project itself. if students are given the instructions and already know the idea it makes it a little easier to get done over the summer. students tend to procrastinate and take their time, which they should, but that time may be at the last minute. it could be august and they have to go back to school that following week and haven't even came up with an idea yet. teacher-based projects already have the idea and the instructions on how to do it and it saves time depending on the project. students can still not do it at all but at least they have the foundation on what to do and start it and have it done with in weeks or days.furthermore, teacher- based projects may be less confusing then when a student comes up with it from the top of their head. students already dont want to do the project in the first place so the idea may be very confusing to other students or the teacher. if the project is a group project the idea may not be understood fully and may get taking the wrong way. students school brains are already shut down so when to making ideas students tend to wing it and just throw it out especially when it is a group project. they think that the other is just going to figure it out on their own and that may not be the case or they leave each other hanging. teacher- based projects make it easier because the idea and instructions are already there and all the students have to do is just follow them.however, teacher-based projects do have a downside to them. teachers, of course, have been teaching and assigning projects all year and some are easy and some are not. projects that are given by the teacher have to be completed by the instructions given and if it is not completed that way or in that way all that hard work just went down the drain. student- based project do make it easier because it is their idea, their instructions, and their own way. so all that hard work doesn't have to go the drain for nothing. student-based projects can be more creative because it is made from scratch and from their own head. teacher-based projects are usually less creative because students are just trying to finish it and get it over with. in contrast, students may take a lot of time or wait till the last minute.in conclusion, teacher- based projects or student based projects can all be very good projects. summer projects can be challenging because the summer is relaxing time, even though all of adults think otherwise, but summer projects do keep the brain fresh. i think that summer projects should be teacher based because it makes it easier on them and the students.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5

D786038182B6,"have you ever thought about the advatages and disadvantages of learning in school? distance learning is being consitered instead of in school learning for some students. being taught online isin't always a good idea. in school learning allows students to work at their own paste, work with less distractions, and allows students to be organized.when students work at their own paste it can be less stressful, they can make sure everything is valid, and they can focus more on their work. stress can decrease by increasing the time you have to work on an assignment. you dont have to stare at a clock and worry about reaching your deadline. you can go back to check on your work as many times as you need to. reviewing your work allows you to correct your mistakes. you can focus when you aren't panicing about losing time to complete an assignment. being rushed by time can be very stressful and cause problems for a student.distractions are never a good thing, so why work with them? teachers in school create rules for students to be sucessful without the distraction of a cell phone, food being handed out in class, and classmates misbehaving.cell phones take up most of a students day and it does not benefit them at all. cell phones draw students' attention by a notification, phone call, or just being on a desk. food being handed out in class creates a ruckess by everybody wanting a snack to chew. wrappers of candy, bags of chips, and sodas being opened creates a noise that is tempting. when a student misbehaves, teachers have the ability to write them up and let upper athorities take action. distractions cut into the time a student has to complete any assignemnt.organization in life can start with school. you have a schedule to follow, you have different subjects, and you have a structure. as soon as your morning alarm goes off you start with your morning routine. first you shower and get dressed, next you brush your teeth, then you may get transported to school. at school they provide students with a shedule to follow. you take four classes a day and have eight in total that are seperated with lunch. each subject has different learning styles and ways to solve problems. everything is structured and not given to a point you can't sort things out.in school learning benifits students to be organized, gives them time to complete their work, and takes away distractions. working in school has multiple pro's for a student's future.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

897004C788FB,"in a presidential vote, does the country ask only one person about who they want for president, or the whole country? you could only imagine what only having one person's opinion could do to this country. having people vote as a whole seems to be very beneficial to america, and may be beneficial to you as well. sometimes it is better to have multiple people state their opinion before you make a big decision. you should seek advice from multiple people because it will help make your choice easier, give you different viewpoints, and improve the outcome of your decision.making decisions by yourself gets hard and stressful at times. seeking other's opinions on the subject may make your decision a lot easier. this takes some stress out of your choice because then you know what the majority thinks. at the end of the day it is still your choice to make, regardless of what anyone thinks or says. there are an endless amount of decisions that people seek personal opinions on no matter how serious. when you're going out to eat with a group you ask them where they want to go. the nfl or nba most valuable player isn't chosen by just one person, it's asked about by fans, coaches, and players to see who the majority thinks deserves it. now this does not guarantee the right choice will be made, but in the past it has proven that it has the potential to be helpful.asking of multiple people's opinions on a subject offers different viewpoints to the situation. these different viewpoints could really effect your on view on a decision. many people make poor choices because they are biased towards what they think is right. most likely you will not get the same opinion and view on a situation over and over again. no matter how you look at it it's beneficial. either you receive the same view over and over and it makes your decision very clear, or you get different viewpoints and a new way to look at the situation.with the help of trustworthy and honest peers, your decision is a lot more dependable. hearing what others believe to be true tends to help. you have to remember to ask trustworthy people, and even then your decision may not be a good one. even some of the smartest people in america, including our president, congress, and all of the houses ask for opinions from the people. sure a few bad choices have been made, but i strongly feel the good heavily outweigh the bad. i also believe that the good outweigh the bad on even tiny decisions made day to day when you have multiple different perspectives. you can't go wrong with other people's help on choices no matter how big or small.you should seek advice from multiple people because it will help make your choice easier, give you different viewpoints, and improve the outcome of your decision. it is truly better to ask around for help on a topic then choose on your own. the are way more benefits than downfalls. for instance, out of all the presidents we have ever had, we've had many good ones and few bad ones. with different perspectives you can either add to your argument or see through another persons eyes on why they think what they think. would you rather take the risk of making a poor choice or receive insight on what you should really do?",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

E459422C794C,"when making decisions people often look to others for advice. whether the decision be where to go for lunch or something that would alter your life people seek others opinion. often times going to more than one person to get advice can be a very beneficial thing to do. getting more than one opinion can be very helpful since it gives you more outlook on the question at hand. by asking more than one person you get multiple sides of your situation, their past experience in doing something similar, and in the end you will be more confident in your final choice.going to other for advice can really open your eyes to all sides of your dilemma. perhaps you want to apply to a school and are having a hard time deciding whether to apply or not. asking someone who may have gone to that school or had experience with something like that would be helpful because they know what its like. then for another opinion talk to someone close to you like a friend or a family member to see if they think it would be a good fit for you specifically. these people also may see things that you dont in a situation. seeing multiple sides of the decision in question really helps to make a clear decision.some of the people you would want to talk to probably have more experience than you do. this would be optimal considering they have already gone through something very similar and know which choices have a bad outcome. a family member, close friend, or anyone you trust really would be a good option for this. if they are older than you its likely they had to make some similar decision and will relate to you and your situation and try their best to help aid you in making a good choice. these people that have more experience in life and are willing to help you really make the difference and help you make the best choice possible.after asking all these people and taking into consideration all of their opinions there should be a pretty clear final decision. since you've asked all of these people you should be able to confidently make a good choice that will benefit you. going into something like a job or a try out is optimal for success. all in all more opinions makes a stronger and more sound conclusion to the problem at hand.an example of this from my past experience would be when i tried out for junior varsity softball at generic_school. i wasnt sure if trying out was gonna benefit me at all considering i'm in 8th grade and many of the girls out there have many more years of experience. i went to my dad for advice since he played junior varsity and has also seen me play. in his opinion he didnt think i should try out because its a lot to take on during 8th grade. then i went to some of my friends for their opinion on it and they gave me the confidence to go and try out. right now im on the softball team and very happy with the choice i made to try out.in conclusion, asking more than one person for their opinion on a problem is very beneficial. by asking more people you can see all different sides of the question. these people have different experiences which could cause them to see things that you cant. having all of these different sides should make it so your final decision is something you can be happy and confident with.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

2AC01E3AB211,"many schools require that all students must attend school, rather than doing an online school, while some schools allow students to chose to do online school. for most students, attending school shouldn't be an issue;however, that is not the case for some students. although some may think that online school or video conferencing would prevent students from acquiring important skills that one would get from daily interaction, some students would benefit from online school because some kids may have more pressure to help out at home and many students have trouble focusing when around many other students.starting off, there are plenty of students that are more relied on at home and taking online school would give them more time to assist at home. for example, my friend lives in her apartment with her older sister who is diagnosed with cancer but still works almost everyday to provide for her family, her cousin who is mentally disabled and cannot work, and her mom who has a medical condition where she has trouble walking. my friend sometimes has to leave school early just to go to her job and works eight hour shifts, five days a week and stays up to do her homework or sometimes isn't able to complete it. online school or video conferencing would save drastic amounts of time in order for her to be able to work more to provide for her family and be able to pay for online school and make meals for her family, while still getting her education. overall, online school would be a better option for some students whose family situations may need a little more attention than othersfurthermore, some students may have a mental disorder that would prevent them from giving their full, undivided attention in the classroom. for example, one of my friends is diagnosed with attention-deficit-hyperactive disorder(adhd). she gets distracted very easily, especially in a classroom full of students. my friend getting distracted constantly by the noises of a student tapping their pencil, someone coughing, or simply the presence of many people in a classroom has a largely negative impact on her school performance. for her, distance school would get rid of a good amount of those distractions, and help her focus more on her schoolwork. therefore, some students who have personal complications, and taking online school would boost their educational performance.in conclusion, while many think that taking online school would have students lack social skills for their future job, online school would have a positive impact for students who need to help out more at home and for students that physically attending school would prevent them from their full potential. unfortunately, attending school is not the best option for some students, and having the choice of online school should definitely be provided to students who would greatly benefit from it.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

053B8755A4FB,"dear principal,you have listed two possible policies about cell phones at school. the issue is common among all schools, considering that children are texting in class. you have presented two very common ideas about cell phone usage; the first allows students to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times, while your second suggests banning students from having phones at school. while both ideas can be considered good, i personally believe that your first idea is the better of your suggestions.if you ban the use of cell phones at school, it cannot stop the students from bringing them. you can stop children from using their phones on paper, but this would not stop them from using them. they could take out and use their phones when teachers are not watching, and use them without being noticed. and when somebody gets caught, they just get angry at the school and have their parents come up to the school to get back the confiscated phone. this will give you no progress, as students would still use their phones in class and just get them taken away. even if they have the chance of getting caught, they would still text or call somebody if they felt that it was something important. also, students would have to use a school phone to contact a parent if they are sick or forgot something, and not all teachers allow students to use class phones. and if they do, a sick person might use the class phone, allowing the germs to spread, possibly putting other students at harm of disease.if students are allowed to use phones some point in the day, then they might not use them as often in class. students could then contact friends if they do not have the same free time as them, and are able to contact a parent or guardian if they are sick. this will cut down on students using class phones, and will help stop texting going on in class. if they believe they have the liberty to text during free times and lunch period, then they will be less likely to text in class. by giving them freedom, you are helping yourself because they are less likely to break the rules if they have something to tell their friends or family and they do not need to break the school rules to tell them really quickly. they would have time to do and say whatever they wanted to friends and family, and that would cut down on students getting in trouble during class. it would also reduce the amount of parents that have to come to school with complaints and to retrieve the item that was taken away.this will allow students to fell as if they more freedom, treating them like adults. if they feel they are treated like a grown person, they might start to act like one. this could improve their studies if they stay more focused in class because they feel well respected. this could also help they pay attention more in class if they are not texting during the teachers lesson. the teacher can not always see if a student is texting, so the pupil could easily get away with it. during a free time, students would be able to get all of their important texts to their contacts, and be able to focus more in class. this will improve the grades of students, and help prevent students from being held back or failing a class. it could even keep kids out of trouble. if a student gets bored after finishing their lunch or while outside, then they could mess around and get in trouble. but if they were allowed the privilege of their phones, then they could avoid getting in by talking to their friends instead of goofing around.over all, i believe that banning phones from school is a bad idea. none of the students would follow the rule, and they would just bring them to school and hide them. this will get zero progress, and will create no change in the school environment. if you let students text during free time, it could keep students from texting during class, and help them focus more. by distracting the students while they are outside or have free time, it could prevent them from doing something to get them in trouble. and less people would be angry. you would not have angry students or parents coming up to the school to take back a confiscated item, thus not having to bother with any angry people. this is where i stand on the policies, but the final decision is up to you.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

7B52C05A4BDB,"does your school do summer assignments? some teachers give summer assignments that require too much or take the whole summer to finish. this statement leaves you thinking, should students make the summer assignments or teachers? i believe it should be student-based assignments, one reason why is that these assignments would allow students to be creative in their own ways. my second reason is that if students make these assignments they can relate in so many different ways. here is why these are my reasons.making these assignments student-based makes the students think of creative things to do. critical thinking would be the number one outcome of these projects. students shouldn't be allowed to make the assignments to easy because although they are student-based assignments, you will still have to think about how the teachers feel and what they think about it. allowing these students to be creative with these assignments is a very good thing. they will be encouraged to think out-of-the-box. they will create fun things that teachers probably couldn't think of.when creating these projects, students will be encouraged to work together. this will allow students to relate to each other, creating different ideas. although, relating to each other when creating these projects is a great thing, some students will think otherwise. some students will say that they enjoy the summer assignments that teachers give and don't want students to take that away. i personally don't like the summer assignments teachers give us because they require the whole summer to do. kids like me want to have fun, not stay at home and read a book all day.in conclusion, i strongly believe students should make these summer assignments, allowing us to critically thing and be creative. teachers want to make you critically think but their assignments are boring and always the same. we need students to put a fun and interesting spin on summer assignments. leaving us with a brain full of knowledge and power.",3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5

DE68828CC67E,"dear principal,most people feel good when they help other people, and they do it as often as they can. they might be a volunteer at a soup kitchen, donate money, pick up litter, help someone put up their groceries, or any other community service. volunteering is a great way to help the community and anyone can do it, however volunteering is called volunteering for a reason. when you volunteer, you're willing to give up your time to help someone else. you shouldn't force someone to volunteer for community service. volunteering is a choice. that's why it's called ""volunteer.""some people might want to help out, but they don't have time. they could have a job after school, plus have to do all of the homework required by your teachers. if you force students to perform a service, they might not be able to reach there highest point academically because they're so bogged down with a to-do list. students would get too stressed out with everything they have to do. stress isn't good physically or mentally, and that could cause grades to go down. not having to do community service would give students more time for studying and other things like an after-school sport or club. if you want more kids to participate in extra-curricular things, you can't add another burden onto their shoulders. you know what they say, all work and no play...helping out the community is very important, but community service isn't the only way for a person to help out in the community. most people recycle, or donate old clothes to a local charity. a recent survey showed that starting a recycling or donating program at our school would have a lot more willing participants than required community service would. in fact, 90% of the student population said they would love to help out with my proposed programs, whereas only 40% would be willing to volunteer for a service. donating and recycling, or another idea you may have that's easy do to and doesn't take too much time, would be just as helpful to the community as volunteer work would be.people who have the time for volunteering can and will do it on their own. i would encourage students to take part in community service, but sometimes, people just don't have the ability to. there is no need for you to require community service in our school. don't force students to be a volunteer, because then it just wouldn't be volunteering. they wouldn't be as willing to do the service, and they might not do the job as well as they would if they did it by choice, and the community service would be a waste of time if the helper didn't do it right or well enough. that's just common sense. please consider my suggestions, and thank you for taking the time to read my letter.your student,student_name",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
31F4831C794D,"student-designed summer projects would be more beneficial than teacher-designed because students will have a wide variety of options to choose from,freedom to expresss themselves and their resources will be known.first reason is because of the different things studnets can do and they won't have teachers convincing them of what they want to see. back then when i was in 4th grade almost every other weekend my aunt would take my cousin,brother and i to this frozen yougurt place in generic_city. the place was called frozen frog or something like that and we would just try all of the flavors when we got a chance it was amazing but we only could fill up the cup plus the toppings that we wanted,so we went ahead and made our choices and we said we would try something new the next time we went to that shop. just like students we had the choice to do what we wanted to pick and get it done without someone else telling me to do what they wanted us to do.furthermore because students choose what they want their project to be about they also know their limits. when i first started playing mortal kombat 11. i was so excited to try out all the new and old characters and see what new things they can do. i told myself i want to try and use different characters than the ones i use constantly. so i do so and realize that i never really play with generic_name or generic_name for some reason but then when i tried using them in a real fight it never really worked out. so i had convinced myself that it was all because i never learned their moves but then something hit me it wasn't that i haven't mastered their moves in such a small amont of time it was because their moves were just the same as mortal kombat x and i am not really good at working with close ranged fighters. my specialty was at fighting with those who can attack at any distance. zoners were my best bet at winning any match. also like students allowing people to see their limits can help others know what they are good at and what they aren't and they won't feel troubled because of a few minor things that were out of their control stop them from doing their job.final reason is because students are already limited on what they have to do in school,so why should they be limited on a project that the teacher has required them to do. truthfully it is just another way to tell someone no to doing this or that or it is a continuation of limiting people on their creativity. back in 6th grade most people had a problem with the art tecaher because she had such strict rules in a way it was either her way or the highway. no one could really understand why she had us doing things this way or that way. with that being said everyone was hoping that one day she would actually miss a day and one day she called out but then i looked around me everyone was having a fun time because they could express themselves through their art. all students need to be able to express themselves without having someone telling them that they are doing things wrong.however i know that some people might say that is not true and if we allow students to do whatever they feel like doing then how are we suppose to make them do anything educational and how do you think it is going to help them in life. my answer to that is allow some type of creativity in their life because you cannot tell me that you expect students to be told later on in the future to do this and this tep by step. that is never gonna happen no one is ever gonna hold another persons hand all the days of their life thta is why they need a bit of freedom =now so they can have some experience with it when they get older.in conclusion,allow studnets to have freedom in their life without having to be forced to do things,students will have a wide variety of options and their limits are know through their experiences.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

B4C4BABFB290,"recently the principle made a big change to our school. he decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. after i heard about this, i started thinking of how this can impact our school. some students might disagree with this new change, but i actually agree with the principle's decision. there might be some minor ways on how this can effect students, however, i think this could be a great way to improve students mental health. students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity because this could make students more productive, help students find something they might be passionate in, and have a great way to make new friends.the first reason why i agree with the principle is because it can make students more productive after school. there are many students who can get lazy when they come home from school. most of the time, i can be one of those students. usually when i come home after school, i always get the urge to jump on my bed and just watch videos on my phone. when i get on my phone, i can get so invested in it, that i don't even realize i have a lot of homework assignments to do.being lazy is just unhealthy for your body and mental health. most students probably have been in the same situation as me. although, if those students were to be in a extracurricular activity, they would be more productive. for example, an activity like playing soccer can help someone's brain/and body to be more active. another example would be participating in any art-related activity, which can help students think more creatively. doing any extracurricular activity would be way better than to sit down and watch on a device. to sum up, extracurricular activities are a good way to help someone have a productive task to do.the second reason why i agree with the principle is because extracurricular activities can help some students find something to be passionate in. there are some students who might not have any activity or hobby they're passionate in. if those students had to take an extracurricular activity, they would have a more chance of finding something they like. some students might even end up liking an activity they never thought they would. every school gives many options in extracurricular activities. if a student tries out an activity and they don't like it, they can always try a different one. also, another benefit in finding a activity you like, is getting a lead to a career you might want to have in the future. it's always good to know what you're passionate in, so you can have more options for future careers.the final reason why i agree with the principle is because joining in extracurricular activities can be a great way to make new friends. socializing and making friends is important for anyone's mental health. friends can be supporting and a helping hand at any time. the friends you make can also build a strong character in you. if you join an extracurricular activity that you really like, it can be easier to make friends because they will have the same interest as you. because of the similar interests, the friends you make through an activity can be more closer than the friends you make in class. making friends gets you to know other people in your school, and it's better to know more people so you can feel more comfortable at school. all in all, extracurricular activities can be the best opportunity in making great friends.there may be other ways that extracurricular activities can benefit students, but the reasons i thought of were the most important to me. with extracurricular activities students can be more productive, find an activity they might be passionate in, and make new friends. also, extracurricular activities can play a important role in life by leading you to a career. for the students who don't agree in partaking in any activity, just keep in mind that it's always better to try new activities because you might end up liking it!",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

0F7934223515,"january 28th, 2011dear principal,community service can be a big way to help others. you usually need to do community service when you are either getting your confirmation done, or if you are in an honor society. some people like to do community service for the joy of it though.in my opinion, all students should perform community service. helping the community can make you feel good about yourself and it is also very helpful to the environment around you. it does take time away from you, but that time is used to help others. if you just stay home all day on the computer or watching television, community service would be something to take your mind off of doing that. or also, if you are constantly bored, community service cold even be a way of entertainment for yourself. community service is a way to get out of your laziness and do something.there are a lot of people out there who need help with your community service. some children for example need tutoring in certain subjects that you may be able to help with. another example is cleaning up litter in your local park or just on the streets outside your house. elderly people can get lonely sometimes and a great way of community service would be to write them letters for the holidays and bring them happiness. if you are interested in arts and crafts you can get together with friends and make artwork for sick children in hospitals. other people love snow. if you're one of those people who love the snow, you can shovel your neighbors driveways next time it snows. the thing is that if they offer you money, you cannot accept it, you must kindly say no or then it would not be community service.for the kids that do not participate in community service, well why don't they? it is a fantastic way to help others and there is no reason why not to do it. i think that as the principal, you should encourage all the students in our school to do community service. if i went around telling all the kids to do it, they would not listen to me. you are the principal though, and you can help me out and tell everyone to, because they will surely listen to you. i want to make a difference in my life and the lives of others and i think you can help me as well with this. please consider this idea of making all the students in school to do community service. not only would it help us, but it would help others and that is the beauty of it.sincerely,student_name",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

20D81D1BE1A6,"yes, the use of facial action codying stystem would be very useful for students in the classroom. not only can this technology detect when a student is confused or bored, but it can change the lesson to grab the students' attention again, or to explain it in an another way. along with this, this technology could introduce a lot more job intrest, hobby intrest, or just pure intrest among students. lastly, this technology would be beneficial to students because it would give us a reason to be taught about the science of emotion, we could learn and go more into depth about our basic human body and mind and how easy emotions can show.this technology can change lessons for kids who aren't understanding, or are just completley bored of the material being shown. this can greatly change a students grades from bad to good, along with make them look forward to coming to your class or school in general. from paragraph 6 the author stated, ""a classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" ending the conversation with, ""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor."" another point which dosn't relate to the fact of changing around lessons for a student would be also in paragraph 6,""...if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. but if you frown, the next ad will be different."" this technology can overall make a students lesson, web browsing, and understanding of materal a lot easier and it could greatly improve their work.secondly, the facs can show students a different range of technology that is fairly new. it could show some kids something they may be passionate for but never knew of, it could be a possible job intrest, a new hobby interest, anything at all. the people using this technology are doing so many things, ""the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-d computer model of the face;"" so they're not only using 3-d software but also, ""using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnition software tracks these facial movements."" the people who are specializing in doing this kind of technology, are branching out in very large, and impactful ways. many students could be interested in doing this, and sometimes if it's not in school and they don't hear of it. they can never find it.lastly, having this technology in our school would give us a reason to talk about the basic science of emotion. we can learn about our human bodies and why emotion is displayed so easily, and how it's displayed as well.

6578E97B8E0E,"dear principal,i recently heard you wanted to change the school policy on sports and other activities, so that only students with a grade average of a b or higher can participate.first of all i think this is wrong, because then students won't have as many after school activities.after school activities help occupy students time which makes it less likely for them to get in trouble.another reason is that students might also drop out or move schools so they can continue playing sports.if students don't have sports they are also less likely to get enough exercise which could cause more obesity in the school.some students rely on sports as a chance to spend time with their friends, so if sports are cut out they may become antisocial and have no friends.when people play sports it also makes them more motivated to do other things and gain more friendships.other activities in which students may not be able to participate in such as electives or school clubs may drop the self esteem of students due to lack of friends with similar interests.this rule might also cause bullying because if someone can't play sports then others will know they have less than a b average.getting regular physical activity in a friendly surrounding also helps people who might have had a troubled past.when others around to support one and other it also brings up the moods of possibly depressed people.when activities are available it also helps students broaden their horizon by letting them try things they might not have otherwise tried.it also allows students to meet people with similar interests.this policy might also be good because it would give students with poor grades a reason to bring their grades up to atleast a b average.it also could allow there to be more academic centered clubs.the students who aren't eligible to play sports could also have tutors in the time they aren't spending on sports.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
765F4BB0381E,"dear senator: i'am writing you this letter to inform you that i argue in favor of keeping the electoral college. why? because this progress is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. a dispute over the out come of an electoral college vote is possible, it happened in 2000. all of this reasons are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal.the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. it can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. in electoral college the electors are the one who elect the president not the people and my opinion is that its a good idea because not everyone has the same opinion. when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. this process consists of 538 electors. the amount of 270 electoral votes is requiered to elect the president. the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. each candidate that is running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. it is necessary to have this groups so you can be the president.well senator i hope you like this letter and feel sure why you have to keep the electoral college. i know you would keep it because you are a good senator and you want the best for everyone in the state. remember that this is very important for the people who think that you should keep this very important process that has grow in all state of the united states of america.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0
07397A3E9D8D,"education is a big factor in ones life. without it, where would our society be? i am a student myself and know the difficulties and benefits of attending a physical school. video catting just ins't the best idea for helping students develop their education. bringing more technology into a society already involved with enough technology doesnt have a happy ending. there are more negative effects that this can bring than just attending a physical school. students wouldn't benefit from taking classes at home because they would start to slack in their work, going to school keeps them on a schedule that teaches them organization/ planning for their future, and it doesn't give them the opportunity to build relationships with former students and their teachers.firstly, getting assignments done in class are hard enough as it is. if students are expected to get all of these assignments done at home, most of these would be completed late and/ or sloppy. even from my own experience, when i'm given an assignment to do in class i finish it more quickly due to the resources i have in the classroom. when assignments are given at home, it takes me longer to complete this assignment because i tend to have lots of questions that can't be answered by my parents or the internet. video chatting isn't the same as a face to face conversation with your teacher. what if the internet is down and you're not able to communicate with your online teacher, what do you do now? as a student, i know kids aren't going to try and solve the problem, this is just another excuse they can use to as why they did not complete their assignments. attending class at home will cause more of a stress for students because they will find other things to do that can distract them from their work. in a classroom, you have one job and that's to get your work done. less distractions are available in a classroom when compared to your own home.secondly, school helps develop a schedule for a student to get used to. if a student were to work from home, they would choose when they want to work and if they even feel like doing assignments that day. having this schedule teaches them time management which helps them develop the technique for the future when planning out different things. my friend, generic_name, has a very hard time planning things such as hanging out with friends, when to complete assignments, etc. she learned how to manage a schedule that incorporates all of her needs and wants into her day. she is able to attend school, go to soccer practice, and still have time for her friends and family. this is one of many life lessons that attending school can give you. when people think of school they think of all the work they have to complete with no time in the day to do it. by developing this schedule it helps them manage their priorities first and helps them incorporate their wants as well.lastly, classmates and teachers have a big impact on a student. some kids go to school only to see those people. my cousin is home schooled. her only friends are her neighbors and her teammates on her fencing team. she is a very shy girl and hates talking to people. if she were put into a school with kids her own age she might be different in the way she talks to people. this is going to effect her future in a way that might be difficult for her to get a job, buy a house, etc. having relationships like those, with other students and teachers, makes getting through school a whole lot easier. these teachers push their students for success and online catting with teachers just doesn't form that close relationship like a teacher you see in person everyday does. i know going to school is hard and annoying, but it's those teachers and my friends that motivate me to go to school and get those positive grades.school is a childs job, they can't just avoid the difficulties it brings because ""they feel like it."" students already try to find reasons to not complete assignments and giving them the opportunity to attend class from their home just gives them more of an opportunity to slack off, lose those relationships they could've made, and leaves them missing out on developing a plan for their current and future life. attending school gives students more than the education they need, but the lessons that can be used throughout their whole life.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

D1AF5CE5040E,"generic_namewriting solmarch 11, 2020english 11 advwhen students leave out of the school building doors for their summer break, i can promise you that the last thing they are thinking about doing is more work for their teachers. in different scenarios, it would be very convenient and unique for kids to continue their learning while enjoying their summer at the same time. they would go to school the next year and only need very little, if any, reminders of what they should've been learned the previous year. i think student-designed summer projects would be an awesome addition to student learning over the summer.many students either get left behind a grade, have to do summer school, drop out, or just barely pass and end up going into summer not knowing any of the material their teacher has tried to teach them. things they should've previously been learning would seem new to them. as a student i will admit that some of the material is quite confusing at times. if you pay attention, study, and do your class/homework , it gets way easier. projects are designed to help teachers grade the student on how well they know material or a subject. projects help the teacher get a better understanding of what the child may need help with in order to get better at the subject and/or to pass their upcoming standards of learning test.there is a boy at my school that we are going to call generic_name. generic_name does not understand the wwi subjets in his history class. he's been doing his class and homework, been paying attention, he's been writing his notes, but he still does not understand the subject. he's asked his teacher for extra help and has recieved it. while his knowledge for the unit is growing, he still just barely passes his standards of learning test with a 401. over the summer, his school required all students to make up their own project about anything they may have learned. at first he did not think it was going to help him but he decides to give it a try anyway. generic_name decides that if he has to learn about something over summer, he might as well learn about something he's been having trouble with. he completes his project with just a month left of summer and now has a better understanding of the war for his next year of highschool.in order to help kids better undertsand things, not only should we do projects at the end of every quarter during school, we should do them during summer too. students will get smarter and teachers would be much happier when their whole class can raise their hand and answer questions about the new material they are going over. students should be able to do the project on anything they have learned from any class over the past year.to ensure we would have less drop-outs, students who have failed for the year, or kids who simply do not understand the material, public schools should take part in making the project a requiremnt that students must complete a summer learning project of their desire, as long as it is something they know little about. the project is expected to be taken serious as an sol would. it is a great way to make sure that students would not forget any knowledge over their summer. also, it would be a great excercise for thier brains as well as it would get them ready for college if they plan on furthering their eduction.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5

ABC648A86887,"the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. under the electoral college, voters vote not for the president, but for a state for electors, who in turn elect the president. the main problem with this is that most of the time voters are oblivious to who their electors vote for. in some cases, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party candidate and cast a deciding vote for whome ever they please... the states pick the electors that vote for us citizens.sometimes the president doesn't even get the most popular vote, but they recieve enough electoral college votes, is this system a scam?many accross the world believe this is true, you wanna know why? during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. how whould these voters know who to vote for if they didn't have any idea who was running? they didn't!people are getting worried and starting to get upset, many asking questions to the public, only to be hushed by the government. the main question everyone wants to know the answer to and are asking is:when is this whole syatem going to fall apart at the seam?some even believe the election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.is the electoral college system ever going to change?there are a couple reasons for retaining the electoral college despite it's lack of democraic pedigree;all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. despite the reasons the electoral college is still the unfair, outdated, and irrational system it could be.in the facts i have presented, i believe that we need a change in many of our systems, today the most needed change is the electoral college system. many of us don't realize, but sooner or later this can come back and bite us in the butt.

0B6B5E779566,"dear teacher_name,i think the idea of having a principal making everyone in the school have to do community service is good, but i could be troubling for some people. there has to be a lot of thought put into making this decision, from the person making the decision and their point of view on it to the people that are going to be affected once the decision is made. all this will have to be thought out taking into consideration the type of community service that is going to be required to do .different types of community service require certain skills, transportation, and even tools. helping out at a retirement home is a good way of showing your community support and that you care about all the people in your community but having the transportation to get to where you need to go in order to be able to help out can be a problem. many of the kids in the school that will be participating in this event cannot drive on their own, they are brought to and from places by their parents. as willingly as this students maybe about helping out, their parents/guardian may not have the time to take them where they need to go. parents are very busy, not only with their kids, but with work, and adding another thing for them to worry about might not be good. this could also get in the way of their schedule, but this isn't something that has to be done everyday, once a week, is better than nothing.community service is good in many ways. if students at a young age grow up with the act of helping others around them they will keep that with them for the rest of their life. growing up helping people with small acts of kindness as simple as getting an elder person a glass of water, helping someone put in groceries, helping out serve food at a homeless shelter will make you a better person inside and out. by helping out others around you with small things can bring big rewards later on.other acts that can be done that are simpler, things such as picking up a piece of trash that you see on the floor on your way home. helping out your little cousin, or neighbor with his/her homework. this acts as little as they may seem will make a difference in the end.i think that the idea of having everyone participate in community service is great. some kids might have difficulties with transportation but minor problems like that can be solved as simply as car pooling with a neighbor or friend, riding a bike which is even better because it helps out the environment, or even walking. and, all these small things that you might have to sacrifice for it, like watching a movie with your friends will be worth it in the end.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
CBA185D3B277,"i think that the ""facial action coding system"" may actually be valuable. the machine detects emotions from using a picture and that can help with knowing how a person feels. the machine uses the muscles in your face to detect your emotions, it calulates all emotions found, and has most of the common emotions so the facs has a very good chance of being accurate and valuable.the machine uses the muscles in your face to detect emotions. this is useful because different muscles makes different emotions, in the article the athour explained how the machine can tell if someone was happy or not. ""to an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" that explains that even if the person tries to change their emotion the real one will still be seen because of the muscles that they are using.the ""facial action coding system"" calulates all the emotions found in the persons face. since the machine can calulate all the emotions it has a better chance if getting the right exact emotion the person is feeling and get all the emotions. this machine would be about to detect how any person is feeling and can show up at 6 emotions.with the machine being able to caluate your emotions its able to detect up to 6 different emotions that people use everyday.

8F4907E2D511,"i am against this topic. i am against this topic, because i think it will distract the students. i say this, because they will be trying to change their emotiones to get diffrent things. i think it violates their privacy and other things. now days it tis not hard to hack into a computor and take pictures of the person on the other side.this facs thing will probaly encourage the person to hack into a computor and change the pop ups or the emotions based of the other persons emotions. it could lead to people making the computor say special things to make a person happy about themselves, but it could lead to them talking the other person to meet them outside school. what is your thoughts?i am strongly against this topic, because if i was a parent i would not want my kid using this product. i say this, because there are a lot of creepy, crazy, and a stalker. it could be used to lead the child to do a surtain thing. the pop ups chould lead the child to see or do bad things. the pop up could be changed by a hacker if they want. they could tell them to do drugs or drink under age. this is all bad for a kid. i would never want my kid to do any of that if i was a parent. i would never want my kid if they were old enough to drive and get drawn into drinking by a pop up ad and then kill someone, because they where drinking and driving.another reason i am against this is for the teachers side of things. say you where a teacher and had facs on the computor and all your students where changing their emotions to get diffrent pop ups. there your students are destracted and are not listening to your lecture or lesson for the day. then you have to stop class and get onto the students. then you may have a kid tell his mom or dad you yelled and told the class to stop goofing around. with their emotions. then they call the school and you then have to go to a meeting about what happened. then you will have to try not to get into trouble by the state or you head leader. this could cause a lot of disruptions in the class and they will not get the education that they are there for. i am not saying that there is not already a lot of destractions alreadyby phones, talking, and chromebooks. it is not going to be as bad as emotion based pop ups.for the muscle and painting part of the passage. i think it had no relavents to the main idea of emotion based pop ups. back then when the mona lisa was painted they didn't have computors or advanced technology. it could of been stated a little bit diffrent. like"" mona lisa never rarly smiled, but now as technology advanced and we now know that muscles change our facial emotions.""it then could help the scientific side of the facs. like now we know that your muscles help you change facial emotions. this then could help us then have more emotion based pop ups. this may sound like i am for they facs, but i not for it. it is a vilation of privacy. what if the kid is having very bad thought like death or harm. which is a very bad thing in teens today. this could lead to those bad pop ups again.all in all i thing this facs should be outlawed in the u.s. and other countrys. i thing it could be used in a bad way. if i was a parent i would never ever let my kid use this facs. i thing it coul sway my kids thinging and ideas. also it would affect why they are at school. i sent them to school for an education, so they can get a could job. if i was a parent i would never want to see my kid on the crime life.what are your thoughts? i am a strong against this topic.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5
768885A4B61A,"participating in an extracurricular activity for school may be a lot of fun for example, yearbook club, sports, or gaming clubs. but going to a after school activity everyday can be a lot and extracurricular activities may not be in everybody's field. the principal should not force all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students may be busy after school, students are exhausted from school, and lastly, the students are not interested in the activities.sometimes teachers may assign a lot of homework to their students. sometimes if students have multiple teachers, the students may have homework from different subjects. or students may have to finish classwork that they did not finish from class. also projects can keep a student busy because students may have from 1 to 2 projects to do at home. study guides also play a role because students may have upcoming test, quizzes, benchmarks, and midterms to pass. some parents may own a restaurant or a shop and their kids may have to work at the restaurant or shop. students can also have tutoring, babysitting, other sports, and taking care of a loved one. however there are many more things that can keep a student busy after school. with some of these things going on in a students life it can be overwhelming by adding an extracurricular activity to their busy schedules. this is why the principal should not force the students to participate in an extracurricular activity.students can be tired form the long 7 hours of school in the daytime. some students may want to go straight home from school to go eat and take a nap. also when some students are testing all day they may want to go home and relax. however if the principal forces students to participate in extracurricular activities then they will be even more exhausted by staying after school for the clubs or sports. some students may not want to stay at school for an extra 1 to 3 hours just for a extracurricular activity. students may have made plans to hang out with friends or go out to the mall. however if they are forced to stay after school then they would have to change their plans. this is another reason why the principal should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities.not all students are interested in the activities at the school. the activities at school may not be so enjoyable for the students. some of the clubs that the students are interested in may not be available at the school. this is why the principal should make clubs that the students would love for example, a fan club for a popular book, a dodge ball club, or a health club. fun clubs like these are what will make the students enjoy the clubs. but having boring clubs at school like yearbook club can be boring. also adding fun sports to school like gymnastics or cricket would also bring the students happiness and would make them want to do extracurricular activities instead of the principal focing the students to participate.as a result, students are busy after school, students are exhausted from long school days, and students are not interested in the activities at school are all reasons why the principal should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities. students have lots of other things to do after school, students want to go home after a long 7 hours of school and do not want to be at school for another 1 to 3 hours, and lastly students are not interested in the extracurricular activities at school because they are boring.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5

1300CBEB1F39,"i stand with the principle on his decision. i believe that participating in extracurricular activities has many benefits on a child's social life. making friends while on a team or a club will be much easier, the students will have connections with others, and everyone will have something to talk about. some students may find it hard to make friends, but by being in an extracurricular activity, there are many chances to find a long lasting pal.you may think, ""it's nice that the students can find a friend, but what if there is nothing they would like or want to participate in?"" well, i'm sure there is something they would enjoy, because there are many options. if a student is athletic, and likes to play sports, they can join one of the many sports teams. if a student likes to write, they can join the creative writing club. if they like to debate on topics, they can join the debate team. the possibilities are endless!although there are many non academic options, there are many academic ones as well. kids who may need help with a subject can come to tutoring sessions held by other wonderful students, who want to lend a helping hand. if a child has trouble focusing on their homework, there is homework club, a quiet place to work on schoolwork, where a teacher is always there to help, if need be. as you can see, there are many helpful options for students who want to work on homework or other school assignments.extracurricular activities can also help shape students into better citizens. there are many clubs that help students learn about acceptance, kindness, and taking care of our earth and environment. partnership club is where students work with special needs children. these students learn how to accept and help care for others who are a little bit different. diversity club is where students who are all shapes, sizes, colors, and sexualities can learn about each others backgrounds, and the everyday struggles they may deal with because of how they act or look. environmental club is where students can learn about how the environment is deteriorating and how we can help stop it from being destroyed. also, they participate in many community service projects, from picking up trash, to measuring the ph balance in our water systems. students learn everyday what being a better citizen means.in conclusion, asking students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is a good idea. i believe that students school and social life will change for the better. it may take some time to see the positive effects that this new rule will have on the school, but there will definitely be a huge, great difference within the school's community.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

12A61F91FC80,"in the article they are talking about a new technology called facial action coding system where the computer can identify human emotions. i think that this new technology can be very valuable for teachers in schools to know when a student is sad or upset. the computer can help a teacher/adult to understand when a student is in need of a talk or needs to express their emotions. this is also very valuable because it could potentially save a life in bad situations. the computer facial coding system is valuable in my opinion for various reasons as you may see in this essay.this system can alert a teacher or anyone when there might be something wrong with a person, whether it is good or bad. to be able to understand how a person feels may be one of the best new technologies created. knowing when a person is feeling sad, angry, happy, etc, can really be great for if they need someone to talk to. it could make things better or make things not so good. just having those options of emotions to be recognized is something very amazing. even though this system can't contol your emotions or thoughts, it can really help to understand when there is something good or bad going on.in the conclusion to figuring out if this new technology system is valuable, it most certainly is. it can be useful in many ways. i think another use for this could be in hospitals to detect if a patient is lying about their emotions. even though a patient in a hospital may not like this because it can see their true emotions, it might be able to help them in the long run. if this technology can help manage what another person is feeling then it can make them see whats really going on, even if they lie about it.the computer will construct a 3-d model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" dr. paul eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. all of humans show the same facial expressions but maybe some at different times. the mona lisa demonstration is intened to bring a smile to our face, while it shows just how much this computer can do.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5
ABBA50242CFA,"some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. that might a good idea for some students but not all. today, many high schoolers from the age of 15 to 18 have jobs. they work part time to help their parents pay for their phone bills, cars or something else. sometimes they might want to work more, but school is 5 days a week, they have to do homework every night even on weekends. going to work after school is very overwhelming. they get out at 9 or 10 depends on where they work, go home and do their homework, then go to bed probably late, and have to get up early the next morning. that goes on days after days. many students can get stressed out easily. so i think attending classes online or video conferencing help lots of students who have jobs. staying at home and study is still better than waking up and getting ready early in the morning to go to school. that might not be a big problem in summer or spring. but winter is the worst time of the year for students. the sun rises later than usually and sets earlier. it gets really cold and there is frozen ice on streets. nobody wants to get up early and go to school or work when the sun hasn't even risen and frezzing weather outside. of course they want to wrap around in their blankets and sleep in. but in the other hand, attending to school directly is better for some students. leaning and teaching face to face is always easier than online. you could ask the teachers directly if you don't understand, and i think the teachers would be teaching and explaining in a better way face to face. plus, you can meet new friends, socialize and participate in sports or any activities at school. so in the bottom line. i think it's better to combine both ways. the students can attend school everyday, except for snow days. they can take classes online since they can't make it to school. cut the students some slack on some fridays. they can stay home and attend classes online. or only apply on seniors. because it's their last year and they have lots of work to do. but in my opinion. attending clases online or directly at school don't matter. what matters is that the students find their best ways to learn and relieve stress.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

FF07E6BF0858,"dear senator,an electoral college is a vote to elect the president/vice president. only votes that count are the ones done electoraly by congress. out of the 538 votes that are going to be done, you need 270 or more to win. thats extremely disrespectful to the people of the unites states. don't they have a say in wether to elect the president or not? thats why you should banned electoral college votes and approve it by popular votes because it is your people's (persons living in america) lives you are affecting.when it is time to elect a new president, citizens want to know thier votes help elect the president of thier choice. in fact it just went to help thier candidate mabey support the presidents election. plethora of catholics voted for romney to win because obama supported abortion. we never know if the all the citizens vote could have made romney win because it just goes to help the candidate help the person running for president win. if romney won 1,000 lives a day could be saved. obama helped with some problems to though, he made obama care, that gave people insurence for less money. him helping the less furtienate is great. in, addition, making popular votes can help your citizens feel better. you are helping them by choosing wich president will help them and thier family have a better life. the citizens know what they need, they know if obama is going to help them or not. they know who to vote for because they are providing what they need to live good life. if more citizens vote ofr one president then another, gues what? you just helped more then half of the us a citizens because they knew wich president helped them more. the trouble is out here and you can only fix it with us.in conclusion, citizens should have the choice of the president because they know what they need and what presidnet will provide it. the citizens have a choice to elect the president. no one knows the real problems but the people and with thier votes you can help them individually.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5
E53B5654C0E2,"i believe talking to more then one person is the best thing you can do if you need advice. although it can be difficult to talk to people for advice, i believe that it can help you deeply. and now here are some reasons why you should talk to one or more people if you need advice.the first reason is multiple opinions, because it can help you have better and more advice if you have multiple opinions. for example when i needed help with a deciding if i should still be friends with some people. i asked my dad and my siblings for advice, my dad told me that if they dont make me feel good then i should not be friends with them. on the other hand my siblings told me that i should be friends with them because they said that i had so much fun with them and good times. then i had to make a decision, and it was a tough decision but i ended up still being friends with them, the reason i stayed friends with them was because we had very good times and i did not want that to end. so me and my friends apologized to each other and we became friends again.having multiple opinions is important, but also just having someone to talk to can be just as important for having advice.the next reason is having someone to talk to, this can help you for multiple reasons like getting better advice and being happy. for example my cousin generic_name was acting very strangely and i knew something was wrong, so i asked him what was wrong and he did not want to tell me anything. so then i asked my dad about generic_name and he said he is probably going through some stuff and that i should give him some space. so i did, after a couple weeks i started noticing that he was feeling better and i asked him what was wrong. and he told me that he was stressed out because he had a lot off projects due. then i asked him how did you feel better and he told me that he talked to his mom and teachers to find a solution. although he was stressed out and he did not want to talk to people he did talk to people and it got better.having someone to talk to is very important for advice but just making better decisions from having multiple peoples advice is just as important.the final reason is making better decisions, making better decisions can impact your life majorly. for example i saw this tv show named beyond scared straight, and it was about kids who have done bad things that go to jail for a day, and they talk to inmates and see how making bad decision can lead you into jail. then on one of the episodes there was a kid named generic_name, and he was on beyond scared straight, and after seeing the jail and getting advice from the inmates, officers and other people he still ended up in jail. so then more kids came into the jail and saw generic_name, and generic_name gave them advice and all the kids were scared because one small mistake could lead you in to jail. and after that none of the other kids there got into jail, because they made the right decision from generic_name's and other people's advice.making the best decisions are very important, but know lets take a review.in conclusion, i believe that talking to more then one person is the best thing you can do for advice. there are many reasons for having more then one person to talk to for advice. like having multiple opinions and having someone to talk to and just by making the best decision that you can make.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
D97A2C636D38,"when you think of the usa  the first word that you think of is freedom or a word along those terms. i would have to agree with you we are a very free and fair country for...most things like voting i would have to say that the electoral collage is the one unfair thing we have and their are many reasons why we should replace the electoral collage with popular vote.the electoral collage is when voting for the president, instead of dierectly voting you have electors represnt your state during elections. the electoral collage is made up of 538 electors, you have one elector for every member of the congressional deleagtion and house of representives plus two for the sentors this is per state then they all come together to represnt during the election of the president. this is how the electoral collage is set up it all seems fair but you, yourself arent having a fair chance to vote for who you want as the president, its like haveing someone make your dessions for you its just unfair. the electoral collage is set up so the electors vote for who they want to win surely one of your electors will vote for who you want  but its not enough you basically have no voice during elections. bradford plumers the indefsible electoral collage he says ""at the most basic level, the electoral collage is unfair to voters, because of the winner take all system in each state"" he then says "" the candidates only spend time in the swing states where they know they have a chance of winning""; he is pointing out that those who are running for president spend a mojortity of their time in the states where they can get the most amount of votes for example they might campain to florida or washington dc but not even go to a state like wyoming or idoh.i think we should have the popular vote because it goves everyone a chance to vote for the president, they can voice their opions out loud and have a chance at seeing who they want in office. another reason the electoral collage is unfair is because the electors might all be republican or all democrat but we as voters dont get a chance to pick what party we stand for, with popular vote you have a chance to say who you want and what party you represent weather its republican, democrat or induvial you at least get the chance and even though its only a 25 percent  chance who you vote for is going to win at least its still a chance. popular vote has its many advantges but one of the best is you can ""get to know"" who your voting for the canidates can come to your state and make speechs, have posters something to tell you what they are planning on doing if they get elected, this gives every state a fair chance to see who they are voting for. and yes they might spend a longer time in new york then ohio but at least their spending time and educating the people on what they want to do and why the people should vote for them. know i know theres alot of arguments on why we should have the electoral collage so let me get to that.in richard a posners in defense of the electoral collage he states that the electoral collage is good because of the "" swing states"" wich he then says "" the voters in toss-up states are more likely to be the most thoughtful voters because they know they are going to decide the election"" in saying this he means that people who live in swing states will be more careful and more thought out on who they want to vote for. yes this might be true but what about all the non swing states like for example texas they could have been careful while voting but florida was not, then you have ohio and new mexico who could have been careful to but compared to florida their votes get lost even though they were more careful and thoughtout.so as you can see popular vote is more fair and also a smarter method of things it gives the peoplle a fair chance to vote for who they want while also allowing them to voice thier thoughts.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0
B5D9F34D2CAC,"have you ever wondered what it is like in venus and how we might be able to study more about it. studying venus closely is worth the risk for more information on venus. with the information it could lead scientists into making better technology to explore mars or other planets. the exploration could also be our backup earth if the current earth in inhabitable. with all the risk it may not be possible to explore venus but if you are determined to find the answers then it could be possible.there would be all sorts of information if we studied venus closely. there are a lot of problems but it is still possible. there are a lot of people that wants to know more about venus. for example on paragraph 4 it states that, ""astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system."" this is stating that astronomers know that one day venus will change and humans will be soon able to land on it without much difficulties.the information just from venus could even help us explore other planets and solar systems far from our solar system. with the information we could possibly find another earth-like planet faster or easier. on paragraph 8 it states, ""...but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" this quote is stating that our curiousty will soon take us over and eventually humans will do anything to findout more about venus or anything in general. i believe that someday we will be able to find the truth about venus and more information or data that can help us with exploring other planets.all of us have thought of what will happen if the current earth we live on is destroy or inhabitable. well our 2 options are either mars or venus, if we knew more of the planet venus and how it behaves. on paragraph 4 it says that, "" long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" this is stating that venus could return or we can make it return to how it was originally and possibly live on it. this is a good reason i think venus will be able to accept humans and find more facts and informations.in conclusion we have wondered how things are in venus. we even wanted to know what would happen to humans if they went to venus. there would be lots of information if we visited and came back perfectly. with all those information we got from visiting venus it could help us with other difficulties from different planets. the venus we know as of right now could be different as we learn more about it and find a way to change it closley to earth.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

BB4B5D896E96,"have you ever had to do a summer project? some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. summer projects should be student-designed because students would more likely understand how to do the project, it would be less work for the teachers, and there would be a higher chance of students doing the project.although teacher-designed summer project would be more academically challenging for the students, students are more likely to understand how to do the project if they are able to design it. for example, when my sister was in tenth grade she did not do her summer project because the teacher did not explain it well and she didn't understand how to do it. this shows that if summer projects were student designed, students would have a better understanding on how to do the project.secondly, a student-designed summer project would be less work for the teachers. for example, my ninth grade english teacher was so focused on preparing us for our final that she didn't have enough time to design a summer project. this shows that if students were to design their own summer projects, teachers would have less work and more time to focus on grading and teaching.lastly, if students could design their summer project there would be a higher chance of them doing the project. for example, if a teacher made a summer project about researching china but some students prefer to research about rome, students wouldn't want to do the project because they aren't interested in china. this shows that if students were to design their own project they would make it around their interests and would more likely do the project as well as enjoy it.in conclusion, i encourage you to write a letter to your local school board and inform them on why summer projects should be student-designed. summer projects should be student-designed because students would more likely understand how to do the project, it would be less work for the teachers, and there would be a higher chance of students doing the project.",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

"" no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades."" having that said if we send them off into venus it would be a problem because they would'n't have any time to experiment and do research up there since theres been problems with the spaceship not being able to survive. ""the planets surface, tmeperatures aveerage over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than waht we experience on our own planet."" the material they use would have to be the problem as to why the spaceship doesnt seem to last long.on the other hand i also agree on having this study happen and here's why. there's research on from the past that from long ago ""venus was probably coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various froms of life, just like earth."" there's other features that venus similar to earth. ""the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. furthermore, recall that venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.""in addition, nasa has came up with an idea on how to send the scientists that are willing to study for life on venus.

E125061E7C8A,"did you have to do a project over the summer for school? if so that assignment was called a summer learning project and it's used to make sure students are learning over summer break. although some might argue that the project should be student-designed, it should be a teacher-designed.students being able to design their own summer projects would not make the project a leaning experience. a student would do the project on a topic that he/she already knows about instead of leaning something new because he/she would want to hurry up and go outside to enjoy the summer. for example, if a student already knows about the great depression and has to do a project on the topic about devastating things that has happened to the american economy he/she would write about the great depression because they already know what happened. there would be no need to go the library or research anything or learn something new. teachers pick projects that will challenge his or her students to excel not only in the specific subject that he/she teaches but in life also.teachers assign projects that will help their students do better in his or her class. for example, english teachers will assign a student a book to read that will have a theme that will be talked about throughout the entire year. which allows students to be prepared in class and even do better in class because of the knowledge that they have gained by doing the project. students will already have some insight on what the teacher expects and how they run their classroom based on the summer reading project.teachers pick projects that keep students up to date on what's happening in society. government teachers assign summer project that help students learn laws that can keep them safe and away from prison and also help save others. it also helps them learn about their state governor and how they are helping the people in the city that they live in and how they can help bring about change to things that they might not like. teacher based projects keep students connected with the outside world.teachers should also pick the summer projects because it teachers student how to follow directions and how to be independent. it helps students learn how to only rely on themselves and not anyone else because you can not ask the teacher for help. the student has to learn how to do it themselves which is a skill everyone needs, it also teaches students how to follow directions, teacher gives out a rubric and the students must follow the rubric to get a good grade. if each student designed their own project each project would be different which would be thought for the teacher to grade and come up with a rubric for.teachers should pick the summer reading because they only want what's best for their students. it helps them: learn,stay connected with the world, learn independence, and be an overall great student. if teachers keep picking the summer projects future students will become the important hard working men and women that will eventually run the world.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
D8F89BE1861C,"dear principal,helping in community service is way to encourage students to help out a lot more and keep students out of trouble. doing community service shows that kids actually do care about their town and the environment they live in. for example if you live by a beach, and there is a lot of garbage, and no one helps pick it up, it can kill the poor harmless animals that might think its food. but if you have all the students help by doing community service it will all get cleaned and we can make sure there are no pieces left behind.if you have all the kids help, maybe we can have an ice-cream day to repay us for all the hard work, so that everyone gets something good out of volunteering to community service. i myself do not like to clean anything, but i think community service would be a really good thing for some kids. and it's not only cleaning trash off the ground but also helping at the elderly home or tutoring kids at an elementary school, like reading books, or help planting trees around their school grounds. there is a wide variety of things to do.if you don't want to make all the kids in the school do community service, then i think you should put up a sign up sheet for students who want to so they can sign up, and have a day or two every week were they leave school for a couple hours to go do some community service with some teachers that volunteers also.also, i think kids that get into fights or start trouble with teachers or their peers, should have to go without a doubt so they can learn a few things about being a bully.volunteering in community service is a great way to keep students out of trouble. if they have already been in trouble, then it well help them learn their lessons. volunteering in community service looks really good on a record, and usually when you apply for a job there is a section that ask for volunteer work, so it could also help some kids get better jobs. please write back or call me in to talk, so i know what ideas are going through your head. i really hope i inspired you to try something different!sincerely,student_name",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5

D1FBC3B9A8A4,"to principal,i think that community service is not a waste of time, because people care about where they live. they want to keep it clean so that when family and relatives come over and visit they might want to stay a little bit longer because parts of the city is so clean. also, it gives a good reputation to the city. then big time celebrities would want to stay in the city for a little bit if they have a concert or something like that. community service is a good idea because it makes you feel better about yourself when you go somewhere and you see that the city is all clean. also if kids do community service then they will also have a good reputation, because you will be one of the kids that helped make the city look good. other kids don't want to do community service because they think it is a waste of time. they would rather sit on the couch every day eating potato chips and watching t.v instead of going outside and working and helping your community. community service can build friendships and help bond with your family and spend time with them more.but instead of making all the students do community service, you should make it were you give kids do community service for extra credit for some of their classes that their struggling with. that will help them a lot. but some kids think that it is just a waste of time and they say that they have more important things to do. also i think that we need to start a community garden. i think it is a good idea, because everybody can just help out and talk to each other and make new friends. we can grow plants together. and when vegetables and fruit are ready to be picked we can take them home and someone can make a pie",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5
21A162D4B0CB,"dear senator,the process of voting through the electoral college was established in the constitution by our founding fathers.  while some say that the electoral college goes against america's democratic ideals and it increases the probability for a disastrous vote, the electoral college still gives ameican citizens some sway in the election and with a completely democratic system of voting there is a good chance that the outcome could be even more disastrous.  the electoral college is a compromise of voting between citizens and the government, it represents the people as evenly as it can, and it still gives voters a collective chance to change the outcome of an election.one reason that the electoral college works so well is that it is not completely run by the people or run by the government.  rather both are part of the voting process, having equal representation.  while democracy is highly regarded in america, it would be unwise to have a vote completely run by the people.  the government needs to have some system in place that gives citizens a vote, but not complete free reign.  if the people of america voted and the election outcome was disastrous, then the government needs to have a scapegoat in place.  the founding fathers understood this which is why the electoral college is still in place today.the electoral college does not give a single voter a chance to sway an election, however america's population as a whole is represented.  not one region or state has enough electoral votes to elect a president (par 19 and 21).  this is a good thing because canidates pay equal attention to all of america's people.  also, in the electoral college, not every state has the same amount of electoral votes because every state has a different population size.  this might seem like unequal representation of that states, but the election is not meant to give each state an equalized vote, it is meant to give the population of america an even representation.swing states give america's people a chance to decide an elections outcome.  in swing states the voters are very thoughtful about their canidates because they know that in the their case, that their vote really does count (par 20).  it is good to have voters who are very thoughtful and catious about their vote.  the electoral colleges encourages this type of behavior among citizens by giving voters a chance to sway an  election in swing states.  swing states can impact an election.  they are an example of how the electoral college, while still not completely democtratic, still gives the people a vote.through the electoral college america's population is represented, the government and it's citizens have equal representation, and american people can still impact the outcome of an election.  the founding fathers of america thought of this while they created the foundation that our country proudly stands on.  the electoral college should stay as it is.  it still works effectively to decide on who will become president.  as long as the college works effectively, then ther should be no issue with it.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

8A745CBCD81E,"i do think students can benefit from being able to attend classes from home. my reasoning to why is because students could learn better in the comfort of their own homes, benefit from no distractions, and attending online classes can help students with social differences.therefore being comfortable can help your work ethic. when in the comfort of your own home it's better to study, read, and stay focused. for example around students or an area your uncomfortable with can stop you from doing your best. but if you are in a environment that your more comfortable with you can work better. when your comfortable you learn better.secondly the ability to benefit from home with no distraction is more cable then being in a school setting with distraction. for example you can choose where and when to learn in your home with no distraction at all. but in school the options are scares. when a student is surrounded by a lot of other students and staff the drive to stay focus can be limited. there also could be students who stop classes from learning by being very distracting tends to being at home with no distraction at all.in addition attending online classes could help students with social differences. sometimes students may have a problems speaking up or asking a question when confused because the pace of the class is way to fast. for example students with social differences can have trouble communicating in uncomfortable places. they can even have a panic attack when put on the spot to answer a question or present in front of the class. instead taking online classes would really benefit. you wouldn't even have to worry about these things.in conclusion i do think attending classes from home can benefit a student. for the same reason as students learning better in the comfort of their homes, having no distractions, and the fact that it can help a student with social differences. i believe attending classes from home can help in many different ways such as the ones that i included in my statement today. thanks for reading and hearing my position on this issue.generic_name",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

3579E5EE4EC8,"when receiving advice, the response you get will be different from everyone. this is because everyone views things from a different standpoint. some people think it's best to keep their not so positive opinions to themselves, while other are going to share everything with you. it's important to have both these kinds of people in your life, because they're both needed in different situations. let's say, for instance, you get a new shirt that you absolutely love. you probably want to hear from your peers that it looks great on you. now, let's say you are shopping and find shoes that you aren't too sure about. in this situation, you're probably wanting to hear from your more honest friend, who will truthfully tell you how they look. you also might want to hear from multiple people, because everyone has a different style and opinion.the examples i listed previously were very simple. sometimes when you are in need of advice, the scenario is slightly more difficult to deal with. a lot of people deal with drama between peers. when these things occur, it's very helpful to have multiple friends whom you can talk to. it's hard to solve a problem when it comes to people, because everyone has a different relationship with each other. if you have an issue with a friend and you only ask for advice from one person, you're only getting one side of the story. if you ask for advice from multiple people, you are going to get many different sides of the story. this is helpful because certain people may know things which you don't know. the way you view a person is probably different from the way your friend views a person and whether it's positive or negative it's important to listen to that opinion because they could effect your decision.another important detail is the age group you're talking to. if you're talking to your parents they might give you different advice then a friend might give you. generally, parents will be a little more comforting and give you good advice about not worrying too much about it, while a friend might know more about the person whom you're having issues with and give you more advice on how to actually solve the problem. both these opinions are great, but they're both different, which shows that it's important to have both these opinions rather than just one. it's also very important to have someone who will just listen to you, while others will do the talking while you listen to them. it's also a good idea to get advice from both males and females, because they tend to have different perspectives, which can be beneficial in certain situations.in conclusion, seeking multiple opinions on a topic is always a good idea. whether it's as simple as choosing an outfit, or as complicated as loosing a friend, theres always room for more advice. receiving advice from many people is helpful in many ways and always works out better then getting advice from just one person. it can be hard to make decisions, but with others help it can be a lot more simple and your decision will probably end up being better than if you were to make it yourself.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

E3EC600A1754,"dear florida senator,i strongly agree of keeping the electoral college for the use of the congress' approval for the newly president of 2016. the electoral college has a lengthy process, but can come in good use of determining the new president. citizens vote for the electors and the electors decide who's best for the country. even though, there are claims about the electoral college not being fair for the people, i still defend it because it has it's good factors, like run-off elections,the requirement that a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal for the people, and the resoring weight of the eletoral number by population.as so you know, the electoral college is a process of the selction of the electors, then the gathering of electors to vote for the president and vice president. finally, the electoral votes by the congress. when the electors pick the president, they look at their background, such as, what school they attend, what they studied, where they were born, etc. they pick someone they trust to do the job. when there is a run-off election, the house of representatives picks the president. i personally think this is a good thing because they picked the person who would do best in the job by gathering everyone's vote to decide it. because no country could have two presidents with two vice presidents. some may say it's unjustice or not fair because the house of representatives decides the whole election. there is also the fact that when determining the winner, they both look at the popular votes and the electoral votes, and they see who got the most electoral votes and they win the election.the electoral college  puts it simple, because they choose someone with a region where they most likely get the most electoral votes. for example, romney was in the south region, and he knows he wouldn't have to do much there because of that was where he was currently from. now lets compare that to someone that was in the area around north dakota. he would most likely not win that many votes since it's only three electoral numbers. so the electoral college gives a chance for the president they chose to win because of where they used to be located in order to get the most popular and electoral votes.the electoral college restores and reduces some of the weight of the electoral by its population. smalls states aren't widely noticed by the president because they feel like they should concentrated in the big states because of there electoral votes. still, small states tend to make it easier for them because they look at if the state was either republican or democrac during the past years and they take note of that. they know they'll win in those states, even though they are small numbers, every inch of it counts to help them win the title of president.therefore, mister sentor, i agree in keeping the electoral vote because of it's reasonable factors that can help the president win. popular vote doesn't tell anything because the people would know nothing about the president or what he accomplished. it should be kept because it has been used for many years now and has been useful for every president to win.to whom i name,v.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
B27585EF3751,"dear state senator,it has come to my attention the many problems that the electoral college has. i would like to ask that we change to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. you see, not only is the electoral college unfair, but it also creates a lie that tricks everyone into believeing that our president was the one that the majority of america voted for, when that is not always the case.first off, the fact that the number of electors for each state relies on the number of members in it's congressional delegation is just illogical...lets say florida has twenty because of its size, and california has fifty. if both states want to vote for someone different, then california is going to win only because of the size and population difference. so really, you aren't voting for the president...you're voting for the electors who will choose the president. an argument can be made against this...that the electors that you give your vote to will be trustworthy and vote for the person that your party wants. how does that give us a say though? for example, as it says in the article, al gore was the president that the majority of america voted for in 2000...he was the one that everyone wanted. yet he lost the presidency because of this form of voting. this is a free country, or so we're told, so we need to be given the right of popular vote.furthermore, the electoral college system is flawed...there are millions of people in america and yet only 538 votes are counted. there is no way to be assured that the person you voted for, or anyone else, was selected. we need to ask ourselves what the best thing is for our country... letting everybody be dissapointed in who was voted for, or seeing that they got what they spent time on going and voting on. this isn't just a captain for a football team, or a manager at work. this is the president of the united states, and he or she will be running our country for 4 years or even longer, so we need to question this method of voting. we are a unified country, and our unity shows what we want as a country..we shouldn't have one thing chosen and get something completely different in return. the election by popular voting would be a better overall choice for our country.all in all, arguments can be made both ways...for the electoral college process or against it. the citizens of america deserve the very best person to lead them, and that's exactly who we should get...the one that america votes for. i know that there are more efficient and fair ways to do this, all we need to do is use them. at the end of the day though, using the election by popular vote would ensure that everyone would be 100% sure that their vote went for who they wanted, and that's what counts.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5

""knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..""(posner). so these electoral college followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don't have to do anything. people can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. in source one, the office of the federal register mention that ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.even though there are people who support the electoral college, there are many people who are against it. in source three, posner states ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.""if one has gone through an election, theres a long process and hassle of being able to vote, but if people go through the craziness to vote, why not make the vote count?""""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.""(plumer, paragraph 11). not only are voters wasting their time to vote but the electors cheat. for example, if one candidate has the urge to win, they will send one of their electors to be on the opponents side so the opponent loses a vote that they believed would be theres. electoral college also may not be fair to those in a small state. ""a large state gets more attention from presidential canidates in a campaign than a small state does..."", as said by posner. its not fair that even the people who vote from a small state, won't really get recognized because there are bigger states to overrule, and even then, the electors will still choose who they desire. electoral college is an unfair, and a cheating way to vote.to conclude the argument, electoral college should forsure be removed. citizens favor popular vote over an electors vote. candidates and voters enter a whole different threshold to express their political preferance. why should the government even have voting if there really not truly being seen in the correct way. citizens want to take a stand and vote in what the mind believes in. take out electoral college, and let the voters vote, actually count.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

19E57B0657A6,"summer projects are something that some schools require students to complete. they are given so students may continue to learn, even during their summer break. however, there is a debate whether summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. while some may argue that a teacher-designed project would give some guidance for the students, others believe that a summer project designed entirely by students would allow students to let them be more creative, students can choose a topic they like, and students can solve a problem they relate to. summer projects should be entirely student-designed to give students a better learning experience during their break.first, students can choose a topic that they are interested in for their student project. for example, if a student likes video games, then they would be more motivated to do their project than a summer project with the topic of gardening. the students will be more motivated doing something they like, simply because they enjoy it. no one wants to do a project that no one likes. in addition to that, students may also be more knowledgable in their topic if they are able to design their project. a student could know nothing about gardening and complete a poor project. however, if a student knows everything about video games, then that student can create a very excellent project, because its a topic they like. student-designed projects allows students to do what they want to do, and have control over it.next, with a student-designed project, students can have more freedom in what they want to do. some students may not like what topic the teacher gives for a project. this can decrease the motivation for some students to do it. however, with a student-designed project, students can be more creative with their project, because people like to learn what they are interested in. freedom will also make students more motivated to complete their projects, because they are free to do anything.. freedom can also allow students to be critical thinkers. some students are the ""go by the book"" students. this means they always follow what they are supposed to do and not think outside the box. student-designed projects allow students to think differently and not just use what they have always learned in school. freedom is key for summer projects.lastly, students can choose a problem that students relate to. if a projects asks for the solution to a problem, then students can choose a problem that affects them. this would allow students to have a better understanding of the problem and how to solve the problem. it would make students more motivated to try to create a solution, because of how the problem affects them. for example, if a student chooses a topic about global warming, most students know about the dangers associated with global warming, which gives that student a better understanding of the topic. in addition to that, the student would be more motivated in doing their project, because global warming affects that student and everybody else on earth. having a problem that students can relate to for a summer project would increase motivation and knowledge of the topic.students should be able to design their summer projects to give students a better learning experience. the freedom to do anything, the ability to choose a topic, and solving a relatable problem are all associated with student-designed projects. student projects will allow students to do whatever they want to do and be motivated. motivation is the key idea for student-designed projects, because motivation is what drives students to succeed. after school is over, there will be no teacher-designed projects, and for good reason too. students will have to do things on their own without someone telling them to in life. student-designed projects are the key to a good education for all students during their summer break.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

CA2987A57568,"is it fair to have teachers design summer projects for students on break? during school, projects are normally done throughout the course to show a student's understanding of a subject. most schools don't assign summer projects for the student body since summer is supposed to be the break time. some schools do give out summer projects, but keep in mind, the projects themselves, despite being assigned during break, aren't usually designed by students. summer projects should be student-designed because people work better with ideas they're familiar with, this gives students more freedom with subjects for a project, and students are more willing to do something they want to do or research.when working on projects, its easier to work with something you're familiar with than anything else. making a project on a familiar concept means students would be able to write more in-depth about it. they'd also be able to understand it better since looking something up doesn't always give you enough info about a subject. imagine trying to write a in-depth analysis on didgeridoos when you've never even heard of one or even have background information on instruments. familiarity with your work makes it come to you naturally and having the freedom to choose the subject of a project is important.being able to choose what you're working with will make a project more enjoyable. most of the time, teacher-assigned projects would have all the students doing or researching the same thing. while this makes the assignment easier to grade and gives everyone a common goal, some people want to look somewhere else. choosing your subject could bring about interesting results and give you a new interest rather than just being given the generic science project where you monitor and grow a small plant for x amount of time. working on something you, personally, picked out could also inspire you to put more work into the assignment.being willing to do your work helps greatly with work ethic and attitude towards the work. researching a subject that interests you, rather than something else, would make anyone more productive. there are lots of ideas people would look further into if prompted and this would be that prompt. students would be able to enjoy looking up information on subjects interesting to them and put them on paper. they'd be able to turn in a well-written paper and get a good grade just for researching a fun subject.in conclusion, having students create their own summer projects would be highly beneficial towards productivity on said project. the benefits outweight the negatives and more students would work harder on these projects. being limited to certain ideas will make it so students don't try as hard to think outside the box. this type of work also helps students find things they're interested in for later. all of these things would help them work better and earn better results, but they'd also find more information and learn better this way and isn't that the point of all this?",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
0959BDBD0FB4,"as a student i have had to ask for advice often to be able to come up with an educated response.when i need advice i found it helpful to go to ask multiple people for their opinions rather than just one. i do this because asking more people gives you a variety of answers because people have varying opinions, a multitude of view points because not every one thinks the same way, and a plethora of different experiences to go off of.you get multiple different viewpoints on the same topic when you ask multiple people. you get multiple different viewpoints because you should ask a variety of different people to get the most educated response. this can help you in finding your opinion because you can see both sides of the story and you make an educated decision from there. this way helps you more than just asking one person because if you only ask one person you only get part of the story rather than getting the whole thing. if you do that then you are unable to make and educated response.people give you a variety of answers when you ask multiple people for there advice. this happens because everyone has a different variety of viewpoints, even if they are the same, they might see it a different way or have different facts backing it up. this helps you when you need advice, by letting you have the full view of the opinion and limiting the bias by using other people accounts to find the inconsistencies. when you do this it is much better than just having one opinion because that person might be biased towards one side and then by consequence your opinion will become biased.when you ask a variety of people you get different opinions from a plethora of past experiences that led them to having that opinion. it is good to have a variety in past experiences because they can help you make an educated decisions for the present but also for the future. when you chose what experiences to go for, you should choose ones that are close to your present experiences but also for the future experiences you will go through. you should also have some experiences from the other side to siphon through the bias of the other experiences. this will help you to make an educated decision for the present but also for the future.to sum up, i have found that when i need advice it's helpful to go to ask multiple people for their opinions rather than just one. it helps you siphon through the bias, decide which viewpoint fits you the best, and learn about the experience you might need for the present and the future. in conclusion, when ever you need advice going to multiple people is the best way to go.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5

(paragrah 6). the author is aware that hovering is not the most effectove technique, but he supports the idea by hinting it will still be worth it because information can still be gathered, despite the limits. although it is not the most persuasive support and idea he displays that venus is a worthy pursiut, it can still perhaps show how he supports it by giving details. he explains although samples of rock, gas or anything else cannot be gathered, due to the distance, challenges can motivate scientists to progress on more ways to study venus, to apply more knowledge. he clearly shows his opinion that the dangers should not be limited by dangers or doubts, but should drive humanity to excellence and advancement.the author's insight on silicon carbide supports his idea that venus is a worthy pursut despite the dangers. simplified elecotronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in chambers. the authors explains it by stating, ""...stimulating the chaos oof venus's surface and have lasted weeks in such conditions"" (paragraph 7). he does not support this idea throughly, giving limited information to convice the reader of his claim. he only says it can last in challenging conditions for a limired amount of time, but does not mention any support, leaving silicon carbide as his weakest support on how using that, can convice people that venus is a worthy pursit depsite the dangers it possesses. he uses only one fact, but not not give enough anaylsis to make his argument strong or very clear.the author supports well how mechanical computers would make studying venus a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. a project called mechanical computers was first evisioned in the 1800s. the author further supports how its worthy by stating, ""...these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all"" (paragraph 7). he describes it as safer, since gear usually ensures that someone will not be exposed to a certain conditon in a inhabitable environment for humans. he further argues that modern computers are more fragile in extreme conditions, and are not as strong as mechanical computers. he strongly supports it by comparing it to other popular technologies, ""...imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin"" (paragraph 7). he explains in comparison, that systems using mechanical parts are far more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces, unlike modern technology. he uses well thought out support and evidence, to argue that venus is actually a worthy pursuit even with the dangers it gives. he believe that studing venus will lead to challenges that will further evolve humanity and help it prosper.in ""the challenge of exploring venus"" the author supports venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presnts through his analysis of hovering, silicon carbide, and mechanical computers. he supports his ideas with evidence and also the analysis he has with his knowledge by research. he uses facts, and not a lot of opinions to express his ideas and belief that venus is a worthy pursuit. he colcudes his argument that humanity's travels on earth and beyond should never even be limited by threats of dangers or doubts. without that, knowledge will be expanded and fuel the innovation of the human world and beyond.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5

""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" ""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""with these two reasons we can determine the value that they would have in schools. grades would get better, some may inspire to work harder because someone or something can tell they are confused and need help. another quote that can support my claim is that ""most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication,"" ""so computers need to under stand that, too."" what this means is that the one kid who is afraid to speak up and ask questions or the kids who cant speak at all will get better help, because the computers can identify what emotions they are feeling and help them.a drawback to having the technology in the classroom could mean that we could give off the wrong emotions and confuse the computer it self. and this could mean ruining the techology or worse. another drawback would be that in paragraph seven it states ""your home pc can't handle the comples algorithms used to decode mona lisa's smile."" this means that we would have to have advanced technology inside of a classroom, and if it is more younger kids its going to be super hard to keep it from being ruined or broken. another set back would be people who suffer from depression, bipolar or ptsd can change emotions constantly and quickly.this is why facs (facial action coding system) can be used in a classroom enviroment as well as being succsesful in said enviroment.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0

2BC448B88B54,"in the year 1976, when viking 1 space craft was taking photographs of possiable landing spots for viking 2 spacecraft, they found a formation in a rock that looked like a human face. the shadows made the rock look like it had a nose, mouth, and two eyes, like a human. this was found in a region of the red planet called cydonia. the ""head"" was nearly two miles from end to end, and it seemed to be starring back at the cameras.the controllers back at the jet propulsion lab were probably quite surprised when this face popped up on their screens, looking them right in the eyes. this sensation was short lived. scientist figured it was just another martian mesa, which was common around cydonia. the only difference with this one is it had unusal shadows that made it seem like an egyptian pharaoh. a few days later nasa unveiled the image for the public eye to see. the caption on this picture was ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose and a mouth."" nasa's reasoning was that the picture would help engage public attraction to mars.this public picture was soon a pop icon. it starred in hollywood films, was in books, magazines, talk shows on the radio, and even haunted grogery store checkout lines for over 25 years. some people think that this picture is evidence of life on mars. conspiracy theorist say that this is information nasa would rather hide. defenders of the nasa budget wish that there was life on mars, as this would make nasa more popular, and even richer, when people use the picture in books, movies, magazines, and more.although most scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing cydonia became a priority to nasa, when mars global surveyor arrived at the red planet eighteen long years after the viking missions ended. jim garvin, cheif scientist, said that they felt like it was a right of taxpayers to see photographs of the face as soon as possiable. on april 5, 1998, michael malin snapped a photograph ten times sharper then the old one. this became popular with web surfers, as they were waiting for the first photo to show up on a jpl website. only this picture showed what they were not wanting, a natural landform. this was not an alien momument after all.while most people were satisfied, others were not. they still think that nasa is still hiding evidence of an alien momument. the face on mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in april 1998. the camera on board mgs had to peer though whispy clouds to see it. perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden behind clouds on purpose, so that humans would not be able to see them. mission controls planned to take another photograph of it. it is not easy work, and it is not easy to target cydonia. they just do not pass the face very often.nevertheless, on april 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in cydonia, mgs drew close enough for a second veiw. they had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view.they used the cameras highest resolution. each pixel in the 2001 image spans at 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 vikings photo.""as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. so if there were objects on the ground such as airplanes or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were"" said jim garvin.what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms that are common around the american west. ""it reminds me of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho"" says garvin. ""thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height of the face on mars."" he added. so weather or not theface is an alien landform or a rock formation, nasa does wish it was an alien landform, just to bring pupiclatiy to the red planet. however, it is highly imposable for it to be an alien momument, as they would have to have oxygen to survive,and they would have to find plenty of food and water to also survive.",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

57B41EC7CB9A,"when ever a president gets elected in the united states of america, the votes that they recieve are from the electoral college process. the electoral college has 538 electors, each state in the united states of america has a certain amount of voters, one state might have more than others. for example, the state of california and texas have the most votes throughout the whole country.some people don't really agree with the electoral college process because they belive that if you vote you are voting for electors of your state that eventually vote for you at the end. for example, if you lived in texas and you wanted to vote for [john] kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. and everyone's question might be ""who are those electors?' the electors can be anyone not holding public office. that's why there's a 60% vote against the electoral college.the electoral college is widely looked at as a person, a non-democratic way of selecting a u.s president that is going to be overruled by saying the canidate who recieves the most popular votes is the winner. it is the electors that elect the presidents, not the people. but each party selects a slate of elector's trusted to vote for the party's nominee, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral votes doesn't win the popular votes. this happened in 2000, when gore had more popular votes, but yet he had less electoral votes than george bush.i think the electoral college is a fantastic method of electing the united states of america's president, because for instance, let's say a person older than 18 who is allowed to vote and knows nothing about politics goes ahead and votes for the presidential canidate that has better hair, or maybe because he's taller, or he has a nice voice, then the next thing you know that the president knows absolutely nothing about the government or politics and votes a president based on their outside characteristics and not by the presidents knowledge or his intelligence or ability of helping the country out. and it's sad because at the end of the day the president that they chose can become so mean, rude,and clueless of what he/ she's doing. so then at the end we the people are stuck with bad leader for example, like cuba, and north korea and other harsh leader that are the president or maybe even  country regret having that disrespectful person that they chose just becasue of his characteristics on the outside instead of paying attention to the presidential canidates knowledge, and thats why we should still stick with the electoral college method.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0
